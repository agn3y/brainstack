# This file will create containers and run it 
# Docker compose will create network and volume automatically if not created already 
# Here, the automatic creation happens beacuse of "external: " is set to false if it was true i would have to create manually before running this script 
# Run it using
$ docker compose up -d

# Do not try to add volume mongo-express it is a waste of time
