Method 01 :

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa                 # Generate SSH key pair
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub             # Show your public key to copy

# On server, paste the copied key into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh                  # Set .ssh folder permission on server
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  # Set authorized_keys permission on server
$ ssh username@server-ip            # Connect to server using SSH


Method 02 :

* Steps to Use SSH Key to Connect to a Server

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa			# Generate key
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub                 # Copy the public key
$ ssh username@server-ip                # Login to server
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh                       # Create .ssh folder if missing
$ nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys           # Open file to paste your key

# Paste public key here, save and exit
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh                   	# Secure .ssh folder
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   	# Secure authorized_keys file

$ nano ~/.ssh/config                 	# Create config file on client side 

# Add this, replace username and server-ip:

# Host myserver
#    HostName server-ip
#    User username
#    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#    HashKnownHosts no


IN CASE WH HAVE MULTIPLE LOGIN WE MUST PROVIDE PATH OF PARTICULAR KEY
$ ssh -i .ssh/your-keyname user@ip-goes-here
