Snap – Install and Remove Software

Snap is a **package manager** used to install and manage software on Linux.

* All-in-one package :  
When we install software using `snap`, it includes everything the app needs — like dependencies, libraries, and configurations — in one bundle. This makes the app work independently from the system.

* Works across Linux distros :  
Snap works on many Linux systems (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.), so developers can make one package that runs everywhere.

* Automatic updates :  
Snap apps update automatically in the background. You don’t have to check for updates manually.

* Sandboxed apps :  
Snap apps run in isolation (sandbox), so they don’t affect other parts of the system. This increases security.

* Basic Commands :
 
$ sudo apt install snapd		# Install snapd
$ sudo snap install <package-name>	# Install package
$ snap list				# List snap packages  
$ sudo snap remove <package-name>	# Remove Package

* Snap files are stored in :  

/snap/ and /var/snap/
