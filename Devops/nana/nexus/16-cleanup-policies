NEXUS CLEANUP POLICY NOTES
===========================

1. What is a Cleanup Policy?
----------------------------
- Cleanup Policies help automatically remove old or unused artifacts.
- Useful for saving disk space, especially in snapshot or proxy repositories.
- Policies are based on rules like age, last download, release status, etc.

2. How to Create a Cleanup Policy
---------------------------------
- Go to: Administration > Repository > Cleanup Policies.
- Click "Create cleanup policy".
- Fill in:
  - Name (e.g., `delete-old-snapshots`)
  - Format (e.g., maven2, npm, docker)
  - Criteria:
    - Last downloaded before X days
    - Released before X days
    - Is a snapshot
- Click "Create" to save the policy.

3. How to Attach Cleanup Policy to a Repository
-----------------------------------------------
- Go to: Repositories > Select a repository > Edit.
- Scroll to "Cleanup Policy" section.
- Select the policy from the dropdown.
- Save the repository.
- The policy is now linked to the repository, but only runs if a task is created.

4. How to Execute Cleanup Automatically (Scheduled)
---------------------------------------------------
- Go to: Administration > System > Tasks.
- Click "Create task".
- Task type: `Cleanup unused components`.
- Fill:
  - Name
  - Repository to apply (or ALL)
  - Schedule (Daily, Weekly, etc.)
- Save the task.
- It will now run automatically based on schedule.

5. How to Run Cleanup Manually
------------------------------
- Go to: Administration > System > Tasks.
- Click on the cleanup task you created.
- Click "Run" button.
- Nexus will now apply cleanup policy immediately.

6. Notes and Best Practices
---------------------------
- Create separate cleanup policies for snapshots and releases.
- Do not apply aggressive policies to release repositories unless needed.
- Monitor disk usage and component count regularly.
- Combine cleanup policy with Blob Store compaction for maximum space saving.
- Cleanup does not delete blob files instantly â€” compaction task must run after.

7. Compacting Blob Store (Optional)
-----------------------------------
- Go to: Administration > System > Tasks > Create Task.
- Task type: `Compact blob store`.
- Choose the blob store to compact.
- Run it manually or schedule it after cleanup to free disk space.
