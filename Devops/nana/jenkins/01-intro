# Jenkins: Introduction and Basic Configuration

## What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is a **CI/CD tool** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).
- It automates:
  - Code building
  - Code testing
  - Code deployment

## Jenkins Architecture: Master-Slave Concept
- Master : Controls the job flow, user interface, and job scheduling.
- Slave (Agent) : Does the actual work like build, test, deploy.

## Keeping Jenkins Data Persistent
- By default, Jenkins data is inside the container.
- If the container is deleted, all data (jobs, plugins) will be lost.
- Use a **Docker volume** to store data on your host machine.


## Install Jenkins Using Docker

docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \                             # Jenkins UI
  -p 50000:50000 \                           # Agent connection port
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \        # Persistent volume
