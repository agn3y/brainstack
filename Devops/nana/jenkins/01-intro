# Jenkins: Introduction and Basic Configuration

## What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is a **CI/CD tool** (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment).
- It automates:
  - Code building
  - Code testing
  - Code deployment

## Jenkins Architecture: Master-Slave Concept
- Master : Controls the job flow, user interface, and job scheduling.
- Slave (Agent) : Does the actual work like build, test, deploy.

## Keeping Jenkins Data Persistent
- By default, Jenkins data is inside the container.
- If the container is deleted, all data (jobs, plugins) will be lost.
- Use a **Docker volume** to store data on your host machine.


## Install Jenkins Using Docker

docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \                             # Jenkins UI
  -p 50000:50000 \                           # Agent connection port
  -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \        # Persistent volume
  --name jenkins-container \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts

## Access Jenkins as Root (Inside Container)

docker exec -u 0 -it jenkins-container /bin/bash

- This logs you into the Jenkins container as the root user.
- Useful for installing tools or fixing permission issues inside.

## First Time Jenkins Setup

1. Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8080
2. Get admin password:

$ docker exec jenkins-container cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

3. Copy that password and paste into browser.
4. Install suggested plugins.
5. Create your admin user.

## Adding GitHub SSH Key for Pipeline

# On Jenkins:

1. Go to: Manage Jenkins → Credentials → Global → Add Credentials
2. Choose:
	- Kind: SSH Username with private key
	- Username: git (for GitHub)
	- Private Key: Paste your private key (e.g., from ~/.ssh/id_rsa)

# On GitHub:

1. Go to your repo → Settings → Deploy Keys → Add Key
2. Paste your public key (e.g., from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
3. Enable "Allow write access" if needed.

## Setting Up GitHub Pipeline in Jenkins

1. Go to Jenkins Dashboard → New Item
2. Choose Pipeline, give it a name.
3. In the job config:
	- Go to Pipeline → Definition → Pipeline script from SCM
	- Choose Git
	- Add your GitHub repo URL
	- Choose the SSH Credential you added before

4. Jenkins will now:
	- Pull code from GitHub
	- Run the pipeline using Jenkinsfile

## Final Tips

# Jenkins UI → http://localhost:8080

# Admin password (first time) →
docker exec jenkins-container cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# To restart Jenkins:
docker restart jenkins-container

# To stop Jenkins:
docker stop jenkins-container

# To remove Jenkins:
docker rm -f jenkins-container
docker volume rm jenkins_home
