### Shell and Shell Programming

* Shell is a program that takes commands from us (the user) and talks to the operating system (kernel) to run those commands.

* There are many types of shells, like **sh**, **bash**, **zsh**, and **csh (C shell)**.

### Shell Programming (Shell Scripting)

- Shell scripting means writing many commands together in a file to do a task automatically.
- This helps us **automate** repetitive work.
- Important: Starting a Shell Script
- Always start your shell script with this line on the first line:

#!/bin/bash

my_name=agn3y
echo "hostname is $my_name "
