--------------
* Hypervisors
--------------

A hypervisor is a software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a physical computer (host machine). It allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run on the same hardware by abstracting and distributing resources (CPU, memory, storage, and network) among VMs.


---------------------------------
1. Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)
---------------------------------

* Runs directly on the host hardware, without requiring an operating system.
* Provides better performance and security because there is no middle OS layer.
* Used in data centers, enterprise environments, and cloud computing.

Examples of Type 1 Hypervisors:

* VMware ESXi
* Microsoft Hyper-V
* Xen
* KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)


-----------------------------
2. Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)
-----------------------------

* Virtual CPU (vCPU): A software-based CPU assigned to each VM.
* Virtual Memory: RAM allocated to a VM, managed by the hypervisor.
* Virtual Disk: A virtualized hard disk for each VM.
* Virtual Network Interface (vNIC): Network adapter for VM connectivity.
* Guest OS: The OS installed inside a VM.


---------------------------
Hypervisor-Related Concepts
---------------------------

1. Full Virtualization vs. Paravirtualization

Full Virtualization: Guest OS runs unmodified. The hypervisor fully emulates hardware. (Example: VMware ESXi, VirtualBox)

Paravirtualization: Guest OS is modified to work efficiently with the hypervisor. (Example: Xen, KVM)

2. Hardware-Assisted Virtualization

Uses CPU extensions like Intel VT-x and AMD-V to improve VM performance.

3. Nested Virtualization

Running a hypervisor inside another hypervisor (VM inside VM). Useful for testing.


-----------------
* Cloud Computing
-----------------

* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers, storage, and software, you can rent these resources from cloud providers on a pay-as-you-go basis.


--------------------------
* Types of cloud computing
--------------------------

* IAAS

* Infrastructure as a service
* Provides virtual servers, storage, networking.
* Users manage OS and applications.
* Best for scalable infrastructure.
* its like getting an empty computer or to make it more easier it's like getting an empty room to start your ice cream shop


* PAAS

* Platform as a Service
* Provides runtime environment, databases, and tools.
* Developers focus on coding, not infrastructure.
* Best for application development.
* to relate it with previous example of room it is like getting a room equipped with fridge and coolers now all you have to is to store your ice cream in fridge and sell it whatever you want.


* SAAS

* Software as a Service
* Ready-to-use software accessible via a web browser.
* No need to install or maintain software.
* Best for end-users.
* To relate with preveous example think of a wending machine. Insert your coin in machine get you coca-cola and fuck off.


--------------------------------------
* Different Types of Cloud Deployments
--------------------------------------

1. Public Cloud

* Owned and operated by third-party providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
* Resources (servers, storage, networking) are shared among multiple customers.
* Accessible over the internet with a pay-as-you-go model.
* Think it like a public transport such as a train

✅ Pros:

* Cost-effective (no hardware to buy).
* High scalability and flexibility.
* Managed security and maintenance.

❌ Cons:

* Less control over infrastructure.
* Security concerns due to shared resources.

Example:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers cloud computing power, databases, and storage to businesses worldwide.

2. Private Cloud

* Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
* Hosted on-premises or in a private data center.
* More control, security, and customization.
* Think it like renting a car you can have it but it's not yours

✅ Pros:

* High security (not shared with others).
* Customizable hardware and software.
* Better compliance for industries like banking & healthcare.

❌ Cons:

* Expensive (requires infrastructure setup).
* Requires in-house IT team for maintenance.

Example:

* Banks & Government Agencies use private clouds for data security and compliance.

3. Hybrid Cloud

* A mix of public and private clouds for flexibility.
* Critical data stays in a private cloud, while scalable workloads run in a public cloud.
* Commonly used for backup, disaster recovery, and burst computing.
* Think like when you go home you use public transport ( Surat ->  Bharuch ) and from there you take private vehicle ( Jhagadia Depot -> Limodara )

✅ Pros:

* Balance of security (private) and scalability (public).
* Cost-efficient for variable workloads.
* Supports data residency compliance.

❌ Cons:

* Complex management (requires cloud integration tools).
* Higher network latency due to hybrid connectivity.

Example:

* A hospital stores patient records in a private cloud but runs its appointment scheduling system on AWS.

4. Multi-Cloud

* Uses multiple cloud providers (AWS + Azure + Google Cloud).
* Avoids vendor lock-in and improves reliability.

✅ Pros:

* No dependency on one cloud provider.
* Improved uptime & reliability.
* Best for global scalability.

❌ Cons:

* Difficult to manage multiple cloud environments.
* Higher costs for cross-cloud data transfers.

Example:

* A company uses AWS for AI workloads, Azure for enterprise applications, and Google Cloud for data analytics.

5. Community Cloud

*A shared private cloud for a specific group (industry, organization, or government).
* Controlled by multiple organizations with similar security & compliance needs.

✅ Pros:

* Shared infrastructure cost among organizations.
* Meets industry-specific regulations.
* More control & security than a public cloud.

❌ Cons:

* Limited scalability compared to public clouds.
* Shared responsibility can cause governance issues.

Example:

* Universities & research institutions using a community cloud to share computing resources for scientific studies.
