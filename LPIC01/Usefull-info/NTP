NTP - Network time protocol
Allow system clock to syncronize over a network and let a device have accurate time.

# First install ntp, sent very accurate time to all it connections
$ sudo dnf install ntp -y

# there are total 16 stratom level 0-15 and 0 is where atomic clocks relies
- at level 1 there are ntp server
- 0 has the most accurate time and as we go far from 0 accuracy of time will not be much as compared to what we had at level 0
