We have two types of clock on any computer
1. Software clock
2. Hardware clock

hardware clock stays on even if pc is shut down.

# We can use this command to mess around with this hardware clock
$ man hwclock

# TO see hardware clock time
$ sudo hwclock

- We have automatic synchronization of hardware clock with the system clock

# Stop system clock sync with hardware clock
$ systemctl stop systemd-timesync

# To make them sync we can use
$ sudo hwclock -s 	or 
$ sudo hwclock --hctosys

# To set tiem in particular format
$ sudo date +%T -s "18:12:00"
