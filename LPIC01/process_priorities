In Linux, every process has a nice value between:

Range : [-20  to  +19]

" LOWER NICE VALUE â†’ HIGHER PRIORITY TO USE CPU "

-------------------------------------------
Nice alue	Priority	Who gets CPU first?
-------------------------------------------
-20			very high	Runs first
00			Norrmal		Default
+19			Very low	Runs later
-------------------------------------------

Example :

{*} kicking of a new programme :

$ nice -n 3 sleep 200&
$ htop 					# use F7 and filter sleep we can see nice level is 5
$ nice sleep 299		# bydefault nice value will be 10 here

{*} to modify existing programmes nice value :

$ nice -n 5 sleep 200&  # starts the process with nice value of 5
$ sudo renice -10 -p PID
