[*] gdisk - Interactive GUID partition table

$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdd		# selects partition

use  ?  for help

and then the further process is same as fdisk

we can use L = list of partition type supported

[*] parted

$ goarted /dev/sdd		# target partition

then use

help to see list of help

if you want help for the list of command that you got from using help before,
you can use help NAME_OF_COMMAND and you will get help manual for that command in particular
it's more than fdisk and gdisk  

$ sudo parted -l		# list all partition
