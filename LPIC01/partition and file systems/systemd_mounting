Useful Commands for Mount Info

$ lsblk -f				# Shows all block devices (like hard drives and USBs), their filesystems, and mount points
$ blkid					# Shows details of block devices, including their UUIDs (unique IDs)

Checking and Controlling Mount Points with systemd

$ sudo systemctl status /				# Shows the status of the root ( / ) mount point
$ sudo systemctl stop "mount_point"		# Example: sudo systemctl stop "/home/agn3y/mount"				# This will unmount that location
$ sudo systemctl start "mount_point"	# This will mount that location again

What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When you use systemctl start or stop on a mount point, systemd automatically creates a special unit file in:

/run/systemd/generator/

These unit files tell systemd:

What device or partition to mount (like /dev/sda1)
Where to mount it (like /home, /mnt/usb, etc.)
Thatâ€™s how the system knows what to mount and where when it starts up or when you run a command.
