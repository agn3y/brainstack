When we are working with XFS file systems we can use this command.

first we need to install
$ sudo apt install xfsprogs

then we can use xfs_repair
$ man xfs_repair

Example :

Create a partition and install xfs on it

$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
select n then p
hit enter multiple times
Bammm, you have created a partition and now install xfs on it

$ sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1

Bam we have installed xfs fs on partition

Now we can use this command.
$ sudo xfs_repair -n /dev/sdc1

we can also use
$ sudo xfs_db /dev/sdc1		# it will open an interactive promp we can use 'help' here

In the interactive terminal we can use list which  we have got from using 'help' interactive terminal and we need more help what we can do is we can use help in front of that command and get more info about it 

such as 

xfs_db  > uuid

There is also another command 

$ man xfs_fsr
