/etc/passwd

In this file there is content something like

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

# First  column is username
# Second column is password but we can't see it 
# Third  column suggest UID User Id
# Fourth column suggests Group Id
# Fifth  column specifies description / context wny account was created
# Sixth  column specifies home directory of that user

# Now ther is a very special directory called skel which is located at 
/etc/skel

- whatever we specify here and create user that specification will be replicated here
- i.e, if we create a text file there and create a user that text file will be creted in new users home directory 

# Another one important file which is located at 
$ cat /etc/default/useradd 

# this is Ultimately a configuration file which is referenced by useradd
# when we create useradd this file will be referenced each time we create a new user
