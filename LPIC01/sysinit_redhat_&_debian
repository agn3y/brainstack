File Locations in /etc for SysVinit

* Debian

Service Scripts: Located in /etc/init.d/. Each script corresponds to a service and can be used to start, stop, or restart that service.​

Runlevel Directories: Located in /etc/rcX.d/ (where X is the runlevel number, e.g., rc2.d for runlevel 2). These directories contain symbolic links to the scripts in /etc/init.d/, determining which 
services start or stop at each runlevel.​

Configuration File: The main configuration file for SysVinit is /etc/inittab, which defines the default runlevel and other initialization parameters.
​
Init System: While Debian has adopted systemd as the default init system in recent releases, it still provides support for SysVinit, allowing users to switch if they prefer.​

Configuration: Debian's SysVinit scripts are straightforward and adhere closely to traditional Unix practices.​

* Red Hat

Service Scripts: Located in /etc/rc.d/init.d/. This is functionally similar to Debian's /etc/init.d/, but with a different path.​

Runlevel Directories: Located in /etc/rc.d/rcX.d/ (e.g., rc3.d for runlevel 3). Like Debian, these directories contain symbolic links to the service scripts, controlling service behavior at each runlevel.​

Configuration File: Also uses /etc/inittab for defining initialization parameters and the default runlevel.​

The primary difference in file locations between Debian and Red Hat lies in the path to the service scripts and runlevel directories. Debian uses /etc/init.d/ and /etc/rcX.d/, while Red Hat uses /etc/rc.d/init.d/ and /etc/rc.d/rcX.d/. This structural difference is mainly due to historical and organizational preferences. 

Init System: RHEL transitioned to systemd starting with version 7. However, it maintains compatibility with SysVinit scripts to support legacy applications.​

Configuration: Red Hat's SysVinit scripts often include additional features tailored for enterprise needs, such as integration with SELinux and other security frameworks.​
