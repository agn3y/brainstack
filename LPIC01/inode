Technical Definition of Inode:

An inode (Index Node) is a data structure in a Linux filesystem (like ext3/ext4) that stores metadata about a file.

Every file and directory on a Linux system is represented by an inode.
Think of it like a struct in C that holds file info, but not the file name or content.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s inside an inode (technically)?

Inode structure holds:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Field						What it means
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
inode number				Unique ID for the inode (like a fileâ€™s identity)
user ID (UID)	    		Who owns the file
group ID (GID)				Group owner
file mode (permissions)		Read, write, execute (e.g., 755)
timestamps					Created, modified, accessed times
file size					How big the file is
block pointers				Pointers to where the actual data is
link count					How many names (hard links) point to it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple Example (Real-world style):

Letâ€™s say you create a file:

$ echo "hello" > shun.txt

Hereâ€™s what happens:

A name shun.txt is stored in the current directory.
A new inode is created, say inode number 123456.

The inode stores:

Owner (your user ID)
Permissions (like 644)
Size (5 bytes)
Timestamps
Disk block address where "hello" is stored

Now if you rename the file:

$ mv shun.txt hero.txt

The inode (123456) remains the same.
Only the name in the directory is changed.
So hero.txt still points to inode 123456.

Hard Link Example (proof inode is key):

$ ln hero.txt twin.txt

This creates a hard link. Now:

$ ls -li

You will see:

123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 shun hero.txt
123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 shun twin.txt

Both files have same inode number, because they are the same file in the filesystem with two names.
Deleting one doesnâ€™t delete the data, because inode still exists.

Summary (one line):

Inode is the real file in Linux.
File name is just a label pointing to that inode.
