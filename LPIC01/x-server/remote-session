[*] Goal:

- You have a server with CLI only (no GUI),
- But from your client machine with GUI, you want to run a GUI app from the server, and see it on your client screen.

[*] Key Concept: X11 is Network Transparent

That means:

1. The X Server runs on your client machine (with display).
2. The X Client (app) runs on the server machine (no display).
3. The app sends drawing commands over network to your display.

Step-by-Step (with Explanation)

Step 1: Install X Server on Client Machine (your local computer)

For Windows:

# Install Xming

Xming will act as an X Server and show GUI apps from remote systems.

Step 2: On Client Machine (Windows/Linux GUI)

Allow other computers (like your server) to send GUI apps to you:

$ xhost +               # allow anyone (NOT safe in open networks)
$ xhost +192.168.9.2    # safer: allow only that server IP

- xhost controls access to your X Server.

Step 3: On Server Machine (CLI only)

Set the DISPLAY variable to point to clientâ€™s IP (with display):

$ export DISPLAY=192.168.9.10:0

Here:

192.168.9.10 = IP of your client
:0 = Display number 0 (default on most machines)

Now, if you run a GUI app on server like:

$ xclock

- It will appear on the client screen (if Xming is running).


[*] Optional: Secure Access with xauth

- xhost + is fast but not secure. For better control, use:

$ xauth list                     # show authorized cookies
$ xauth add <details>           # add a cookie manually

When you use xauth, it creates a special file:

~/.Xauthority

This file holds the authentication cookie used to let only trusted users run apps on your X server.

-----------------------------------------------------
Part			Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------
xming		    Acts as X Server on client (Windows)
xhost		    Controls who can use your display
DISPLAY			Tells app where to show GUI (your IP)
xauth			Safer, user-level access control
Xauthority		Holds secret cookie for secure access
