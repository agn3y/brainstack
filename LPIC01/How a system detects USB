What Happens When You Plug in a USB (Hot Plug Event)

Device is Plugged In

You plug a USB device (example: USB drive).

* Kernel Detects It

The Linux Kernel sees the new hardware.

It generates an event (called a udev event).

Kernel Sends Event to udev

udev is a user-space daemon that manages devices.

It listens for hardware changes (like USB insert/remove).

* udev Matches Rules

udev checks your systemâ€™s rules files in:

/etc/udev/rules.d/
/lib/udev/rules.d/

These rules tell Linux what to do with the new device.

* File Appears in /dev/

If everything is good, udev will create a device file like:

/dev/sdb
/dev/ttyUSB0

* Optionally Triggers Actions

It can auto-mount the USB.

Or run a custom script (if you define it in udev rules).
