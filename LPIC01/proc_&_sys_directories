---------------------------------------
* /proc and /sys – Virtual Directories
---------------------------------------

Both /proc and /sys are called virtual directories.

They do not exist on the physical hardware (like your hard drive).

Instead, when the system boots up, the Linux kernel creates them in memory.

These directories give you real-time information about your system and allow the system (and you) to interact with the kernel and hardware.

--------------------------------
/proc – Process and Kernel Info
--------------------------------

This directory gives info about the running system, processes, and kernel settings.

Examples:

/proc/cpuinfo → Shows details about your CPU

/proc/meminfo → Shows memory (RAM) usage

/proc/[PID] → Each process has its own folder here

-------------------------------
/sys – Hardware and Device Info
-------------------------------

This is used to interact with kernel modules and hardware.

More structured than /proc, and more focused on devices.

Examples:

/sys/class/net/ → Info about network interfaces (like eth0, lo)

/sys/block/ → Info about block devices (like your hard drive)
