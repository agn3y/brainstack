xarg - extended arguments

xargs takes output from one command and uses it as input for another command.

$ touch aniridh agney ayush
$ echo "is angry" | xargs -n1 ls

Example :

$ ls | xargs -n1 -I {} echo "{} is angry" 

Explanation:

xargs -n1 → handle one name at a time
$ -I {} → placeholder where the name goes
echo "{} is angry" → puts name in {}

use -t flag to see what is the actual command

$ ls | grep -tn1 echo "my name is"
$ ls | xargs -I {} echo "when {} is Angry, don't go near to him"
$ seq 10 | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "This is file Number {}" > file{}.txt'
