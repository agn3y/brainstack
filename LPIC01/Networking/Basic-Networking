# OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

The OSI Model is a 7-layer framework used to understand and design how data moves from one computer to another over a network. Each layer has a specific job. Data passes from top to bottom at the sender and bottom to top at the receiver.

Layer 7: Application Layer

Purpose : Interface between user and network. Provides services to applications.

What it does :

  * Email, file transfer, web browsing.
  * Sends user commands to the lower layers.

Protocols :

  * HTTP, HTTPS ‚Üí Web browsing
  * FTP ‚Üí File transfer
  * SMTP, IMAP, POP3 ‚Üí Email
  * DNS ‚Üí Domain name to IP

Data unit : Data

#####

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Purpose : Makes data readable for the application layer.

What it does :

  * Translates, encrypts, or compresses data.
  * Example: JPEG, MP4, TLS encryption.

Protocols :

  * SSL/TLS (used for HTTPS)
  * Encoding: ASCII, JPEG, MP3, MPEG

Data unit : Data

#####

Layer 5: Session Layer

Purpose : Manages sessions (start, maintain, end communication).

What it does :

  * Handles logins, authentication.
  * Keeps sessions alive.
  
Protocols :
NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP

Data unit : Data

#####

Layer 4: Transport Layer

Purpose : Reliable or unreliable data transfer.

What it does :

  * Breaks data into **segments**.
  * Adds port numbers.
  * Handles retransmission, error recovery.

Key Concepts :

Ports : Identify app (e.g., port 80 = HTTP).

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
Reliable (handshake, resend lost data).

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) :
Fast but no guarantee (used for streaming, DNS).

Protocols :
TCP, UDP

Data unit : Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)

#####

Layer 3: Network Layer

Purpose : Routing data between devices on different networks.

What it does :

  * Adds **IP address**.
  * Finds the best path for data.
  * Handles packet delivery.

Protocols :

  * IP (IPv4, IPv6)
  * ICMP (ping)
  * ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
  * OSPF, BGP (routing)

Devices :

Routers work at this layer.

Data unit : Packet

#####

Layer 2: Data Link Layer

Purpose : Node-to-node delivery, error detection, and physical addressing.
What it does :

- Adds **MAC address**.
- Detects errors in frame (CRC).
- Divided into 2 sub-layers:

LLC (Logical Link Control) : Flow control, error check.
MAC (Media Access Control) : MAC addressing, access to physical medium.

Protocols :

Ethernet, PPP, Frame Relay, HDLC

Devices :
Switches, NICs operate here.

Data unit : Frame

#####

Layer 1: Physical Layer

Purpose : Transmits raw bits over physical medium.

What it does :

- Converts 1s and 0s to electrical, light, or radio signals.
- Includes cables, connectors, voltage levels.

Devices :

Hubs, repeaters, cables.

Data unit : Bits

### üåê TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP is the real-world model used on the internet. It has **4 layers**. It is simpler than OSI but works similarly.

---

## **üîπ Layer 1: Network Interface (Link Layer)**

* Combines OSI layers 1 (Physical) and 2 (Data Link).
* Handles:

  * Hardware addressing (MAC).
  * Transmission over wires/wireless.
* Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP
* Device: Switches, NICs
* Data unit: **Frame**

---

## **üîπ Layer 2: Internet Layer**

* Matches OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer).
* Adds IP headers.
* Routes packets across networks.
* Protocols:

  * IP (IPv4/IPv6)
  * ICMP, ARP, OSPF, BGP
* Device: Routers
* Data unit: **Packet**

---

## **üîπ Layer 3: Transport Layer**

* Same as OSI Layer 4.
* Adds **ports**.
* Ensures data delivery.
* Protocols:

  * TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)
* Data unit: **Segment / Datagram**

---

## **üîπ Layer 4: Application Layer**

* Combines OSI Layers 5, 6, 7.
* Handles:

  * User interfaces, data formatting, sessions.
* Protocols:

  * HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS, SMTP
* Data unit: **Data**
