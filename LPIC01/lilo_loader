Bootloader is a program that helps system to load operating system

LILO only works with MBR and it cannot handle UEFI

What is LILO?

LILO stands for Linux Loader.
It is a boot loader used to load Linux (or other OSes) into memory when the computer starts.
It was used before GRUB became popular.

‚öôÔ∏è How LILO Works (Simple Idea)

When your PC powers on, BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootloader.
LILO is installed in the MBR (Master Boot Record) or boot sector.
LILO loads the Linux kernel from a configured partition.
The kernel then starts the Linux OS.

üóÇÔ∏è LILO Configuration File

The main configuration file for LILO is:

/etc/lilo.conf

You edit this file to tell LILO:

Where your kernel is
What partitions exist
What OSes you want to boot
Timeouts, labels, etc.

üìÑ Sample /etc/lilo.conf file:

=================================================================
boot=/dev/sda          # Where LILO installs (MBR of /dev/sda)  |
prompt                 # Show boot prompt                       |
timeout=100            # Wait 10 seconds (100 = 10s)            |
default=linux          # Boot this label by default             |
                                                                |
image=/boot/vmlinuz    # Path to Linux kernel                   |
  label=linux          # Name shown in boot menu                |
  root=/dev/sda1       # Root partition                         |
  read-only            # Kernel loads root as read-only         |
                                                                |
other=/dev/sda2        # Boot another OS (e.g., Windows)        |
  label=windows                                                 |

üõ†Ô∏è How to Configure and Use LILO

Step 1: Install LILO (if not already)

$ sudo apt install lilo        # Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo yum install lilo        # RHEL/CentOS (if available)

Step 2: Edit the Config File

$ sudo nano /etc/lilo.conf

Make sure your config points to the correct kernel and root partition.

Step 3: Apply Configuration (IMPORTANT)

$ sudo lilo

‚ö†This writes LILO to the MBR, so always check your config before running it.

üìå LILO Key Info

------------------------------------------------------------
Feature				    	Info
------------------------------------------------------------
Config file					/etc/lilo.conf
Must run after change		sudo lilo
Installed to				MBR (/dev/sda) or boot sector
OS support					Can boot Linux, Windows, etc.

üìå LILO Limitations

No auto-update for new kernels.
Must run sudo lilo every time you change /etc/lilo.conf or install a new kernel.
Limited support for large disks and new filesystems.
