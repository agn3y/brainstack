FHS - File Hierarchy System

/ - root dir

/bin - contain command binary (commands such as ls, cat, lsblk)

/boot - contain bootloader files and kernel files (like vmlinuz, initrd, grub config files)

/dev - contains device files (like /dev/sda, /dev/null, etc.)

/etc - contains all configuration files (system-wide config like fstab, hostname, ssh/)

/home - contains home directory for users on system (like /home/user1, /home/shun)

/lib - contains libraries that are useful to run binary files located into /bin

/lib32 and /lib64 - contains libraries for both type of system 32 and 64 (used by applications and binaries)

/lost+found - special directory that contains outdated data or recovered files after improper shutdown (used by fsck)

/media - works as mount points to connect external devices (like USBs and CDs)

/mnt - works same as media directory and there is no functional difference (but used for temporary manual mounts)

/opt - reserved for add-on application packages, packages which are not part of system itself (like Chrome or VMware)

/proc - does not actually exist on hardware itself but gets created when system boots up, it contains all the running processes and system info (like /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo)

/root - much more like home directory for the root user (not to be confused with /)

/run - simply supplies runtime variable data, things such as apache2, udev, systemd related data can be found in this directory (cleared on reboot)

/sbin - binary shells for only super user (commands like reboot, fsck, fdisk, etc.)

/snap - snapd package manager (used to store snap apps and versions)

/srv - data brought via FTP server or webserver will be stored here (example: /srv/www, /srv/ftp)

/sys - contains information about device, kernel and file systems etc (virtual filesystem created by kernel)

/tmp - contains temporary data (deleted on reboot, used by apps for temp storage)

/usr - contains user data like applications, libraries, documentation (includes /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/local)

/var - this is where we keep our variable files (like logs in /var/log, mails, caches, spool)
