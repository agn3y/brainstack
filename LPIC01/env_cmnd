[*] env Command â€“ Shows Environment Variables

[*] This command shows only exported (global) environment variables.
$ env


[*] What is an Exported Variable?
There are two types of environment variables:

[*] Local Environment Variable
Limited to the current terminal session only.

[*] Global Environment Variable
Accessible by any process or terminal started from the current one.

[*] How to Create a Global Variable

$ export MYNAME="baba bihari"
This makes MYNAME available to all child processes (like scripts or new shells).

[*] How to Remove the Variable

$ unset MYNAME

Don't use $ when unsetting. Use the variable name only.
