GPG - gnu privacy guard
Data integrity and Higher security

First install rng-tools using sudo apt install rng-tools.

To generate gpg keys use

$ gpg --gen-key or gpg --full-generate-key 

Suppose we want to use this what we can do is

$ gpg -r yourbutt@gmail.com --encrypt file.txt 
 
To decrypt it we can use

$ gpg --decrypt file.txt.gpg 

To create your public key we can use

$ gpg --export yourbutt@gmail.com > mypubkey.pub

How to create a digital signature for a file

$ gpg --detach-sign file.txt 

now we can send both sign file and original file to receiver

The receiver can verify flies integrity by using

$ gpg --verify file.txt.sign file.txt 

if all went good it will show everything good and good signature.
