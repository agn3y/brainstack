egrep - extended global regular expression parser

[1] grep – basic search tool

🔸Searches for text patterns in files using basic regex.

🔸 Use When:
You just need simple matching.
You don’t need |, +, ?, or ().

🔸 Example:

$ grep "error" log.txt

[2] egrep – extended grep

🔸 Same as grep -E. Supports extended regex (ERE).

Can use:

| → OR

+ → One or more

? → Zero or one

() → Grouping

🔸 Use When:
You want more powerful matching.

You use |, +, ?, () in your pattern.

🔸 Example:

$ egrep "cat|dog" pets.txt

Or (modern way):

$ grep -E "cat|dog" pets.txt

[3] fgrep – fixed grep
🔸 What:
Same as grep -F. No regex at all. Matches text exactly as typed.

🔸 Use When:
Your pattern has special characters like . or * and you want them to be treated as plain text.

You want faster searching (no regex).

🔸 Example:

fgrep "x.y" file.txt

✅ Will match lines with x.y (not "x followed by anything followed by y")

🧠 4. rgrep – recursive grep
🔸 What: Same as:

$ grep -r "pattern" folder/

It searches in all files inside folders (recursively).

🔸 Use When:
You want to search inside many files in folders.

🔸 Example:

$ rgrep "password" /etc/

✅ Will search for the word password in all files under /etc/.
