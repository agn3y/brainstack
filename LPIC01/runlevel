to chek runlevel we can use

$ runlevel

expected output : 

N 3 

N = beacuse there was no runlevel used before and bydefault system boots in runlevel 3 there's why that's N
3 = current run level

use init / telinit command to change runlevel

$ init 0 (powerof)

use of telinit is recommended to change runlevels

$ telinit 0

use 

$ init --help 

to identify  which runlevel do what
