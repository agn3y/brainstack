Job is a process which runs in background
 
[*]Manual way :

$ sleep 500  		# command for sleep 500 then ctrl + z which will stop it
$ jobs    		# to list jobs which are held in background
$ bg "JOB NUMBER"	# this will start running the process in background which we stopped earlier using ctrl + z
$ fg "JOB NUMBER"	# to get back the job to foregroound

[*] Automatic way :

$ sleep 400& 		# use & at the ending of command
$ jobs			# list jobs running in background
# fg "JOB NUMBER"   	# to get back the process to foreground
# jobs -l 		# list jobs with their corresponding PID
