What is Upstart?

Upstart is a program in Linux that starts, stops, and manages other programs (like services) when the system boots, runs, or shuts down.

Think of Upstart like a manager at a factory:

When the factory (your computer) starts,
The manager (Upstart) checks a list of workers (programs like network, Bluetooth, etc.)
And starts them one by one.
Later, it can also stop or restart them if needed.

Why was Upstart created?

Before Upstart, Linux used a very old system called SysVinit.
But SysVinit was slow and didn’t handle events well (like "USB plugged in" or "network connected").
So, Ubuntu and some other systems started using Upstart because:
It is faster.
It can react to events (like network up, hardware change).
It handles parallel starts (can run many things at once).

How does Upstart work?

Upstart listens for events. For example:

"startup" → start some services.
"filesystem mounted" → start other services.
"network is up" → start network apps.

Each service has a .conf file in /etc/init/. Example:

$ /etc/init/ssh.conf

This file tells Upstart:

When to start
What command to run
What events to wait for

Example inside a .conf file:

$ start on filesystem and net-device-up IFACE=eth0
$ stop on runlevel [016]

$ exec /usr/sbin/sshd -D

Is Upstart still used?

No, most modern Linux systems stopped using Upstart.

Now, they use systemd, which is faster and more powerful.

But older Ubuntu versions like Ubuntu 14.04 used Upstart by default.
