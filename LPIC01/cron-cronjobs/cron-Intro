- Cron is a commandline utility which schedules job/ automating tasks
- It is a daemon with help of we can schedule tasks

# Important files realted to cron is located in /etc

- etc/crontab
- etc/cron.d

# To edit it with the file or edit cronjobs
$ crontab -e

# To remove crontab file
$ crontab -r 		# we dont have to specify user 

# To remove crontab file for a specific user
$ crontab -r -u username

# To list crontab for user
$ crontan -l
$ crontab -l -U username			# to list for a particular user


### There are two special files which can allow or deny users from creating cronjobs ###
1. cron.allow
2. cron.deny

- Here this file must be created by super user in etc directory
- When we create this two files
- To allow or deny user from accessing it we just have to edit and type username in it
- Suppose if we have common user mentioned in both file it would get allowed to create cronjob
- If we create allow or deny file it will overwrite current default setting so we should always create pair of this files. else, it will overwite the default settings.
