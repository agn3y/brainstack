What is Swapping ?

information about swapping can be found at /proc/swaps && /etc/fstab

Swapping is a memory management technique where the kernel moves inactive pages from physical memory (RAM) to a swap space (usually on disk) to free up RAM for active processes.

Key Concepts:

1. Pages:

Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages (commonly 4 KB).

The Page Frame is the physical block in RAM.

The Page Table tracks where each page is (in RAM or on disk).

2. Swap Space:

Located on a disk (HDD/SSD).

Can be a dedicated partition or a swap file.

Managed by the Linux Virtual Memory Manager (VMM).

3. Swapping Out & In:

Swapping out = moving less-used pages from RAM to swap space.

Swapping in = bringing a page back to RAM when needed.

When Does Swapping Happen?

When RAM is full or near full.

The kernel uses a page replacement algorithm (like LRU - Least Recently Used).

Only inactive or low-priority pages are swapped out.

üìä Tools to Monitor:

free -m            # Shows RAM and swap usage
vmstat 1           # Shows memory and swap activity
top / htop         # Real-time swap usage
cat /proc/swaps    # Detailed swap info

Swapiness (swap tendency):

Controlled by /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

Value between 0-100

0 = Avoid swapping, prefer RAM

100 = Aggressive swapping

$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
 
Downsides of Swapping:

Disk is slower than RAM ‚Üí performance drops.

Excessive swapping leads to thrashing (CPU spends more time moving pages than running processes).

Benefits:

Prevents out-of-memory (OOM) crashes.

Enables memory overcommitment.

Supports hibernation.

* swapon ‚Äî Activate Swap

This command is used to enable swap on a device (partition or file).

Syntax:

swapon [options] [swap device or file]

$ sudo swapon /swapfile

This turns on the /swapfile so the system can start using it.

üîç To see current swap usage:

$ swapon -s     # Shows active swap spaces (short output)

Or:

free -h       # Shows RAM and swap memory usage

swapoff ‚Äî Deactivate Swap

This command is used to disable a swap space. After this, Linux stops using that swap area.

$ swapoff [options] [swap device or file]

Example:

$ sudo swapoff /swapfile
This disables the use of /swapfile.

When to Use
 
Use swapon when:

You create a new swap file/partition.

You reboot and want to activate swap manually.

You want to temporarily add more swap.

Use swapoff when:

You want to remove swap safely.

You want to delete or resize a swap file.

You are testing performance without swap.

Important Notes

You must have root (sudo) to use swapon or swapoff.

If you remove swap permanently, also remove its entry from /etc/fstab.
