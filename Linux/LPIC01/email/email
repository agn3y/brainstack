We have multiple smaller programmes which handles particular tasks in context of email

Linux email aechutecture is broken down into 3 components:

1.MTA - mail transfer agent. transfers all incoming mail to MDA. ut can communicate with other MTA's
 
2.MDA - mail delivery agent. delivers mess that it receives from MTA and moves them to users inbox 

3.MUA - main user agent. it don't receive any messages actually, just read messages which are already stored on server

When we send email we use SMTP

Example of MTA :

1. sendmail (OG)
2. Postfix  (Simple and Secure)
3. EXiM     (more flexible compared to other)
4. QMail    (simpler then sendmail,better and secure)

Example of MDA :

1. Binmail 	# command for this is mail

# One important location to remember
#  /var/spool/mail
