Systemd vs Telinit

This is an updated method compared to using telinit and init. Instead of using telinit or init to change system runlevels, we use targets in systemd.

Example:

To switch to the reboot target (reboot the system), you would run:

$ sudo systemctl isolate reboot.target

Here, isolating a target means changing the system's current state to the one defined by the target.

What is a Unit File?

A unit file is a configuration file that tells systemd how to manage a service or system component. These files control the state of services, timers, and other system tasks.

Example unit file:

/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service

Listing Unit Files

To list all systemd unit files, you can use:

$ sudo systemctl list-unit-files

This command will display the configuration for all unit files, whether they are active or not.

Types of Unit Files
Unit files come in different types, each controlling a different part of the system:

Services (.service)
Controls system services (e.g., nginx.service, ssh.service)

Sockets (.socket)
Controls socket-based communication

Targets (.target)
Defines different system states (e.g., reboot.target, multi-user.target)

Timers (.timer)
Controls time-based actions (similar to cron jobs)

Example Output of list-unit-files:

UNIT FILE            STATE
ssh.service          enabled
nginx.service        disabled
reboot.target        static

enabled: Starts automatically at boot

disabled: Does not start automatically

static: Cannot be started directly but is used by other units

Difference Between list-units and list-unit-files
systemctl list-units: Shows only currently active or loaded units (running or in use right now).

systemctl list-unit-files: Shows all unit files, including those not currently active, and their startup states (enabled, disabled, static, etc.).

Summary of Commands:
systemctl list-units: Displays active services and units.

systemctl list-unit-files: Displays all installed unit files and their current configuration (whether enabled, disabled, or static).

Run-level	Target			Explanation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0		poweroff.target		This run level/target is used by systemd to power-off or halt the system
  1		rescue.target		This run level/target is used by systemd to boot the system in rescue or recovery mode. 
							It is very helpful if some goes wrong you can change the configuration in that mode
  2		multi-user.target	This run level/target is used by systemd to boot system into multi-user environment so user can work in parallel
  3		multi-user.target	
  4		multi-user.target	
  5		graphical.target	This run level/target is used by systemd to boot system into multi-user graphical environment so user can work in parallel in graphical mode
  6		reboot.target		This run level/target is used by systemd to reboot the system
  
  $ sudo systemctl get-defualt --> to see default target / runlevel
  
  $ sudo systemctl set-default rescue.target --> to set default target
