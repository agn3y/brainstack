Characterset 
1 > ASCI
2 > ISO-8859
3 > Unicode
4 > UTF
5 > UTF-8

- Why this many charcter set ? beacuse we cannot have every language included in one characterset though we can make use of UTF-8 

- Supoese we wrote a string but there was i word which is in polish so we need to copy that word and paste beacuse we might be using ASCII and it does not include polish characters 

- To check this write some common english word and then use 
$ file demo.txt

- Now add the polish word and do this again
$ file demo.txt 

- First time you will see that encoding of text is in ACSII
- In second time you will see that encoding is changed to UTF-8
