# A User can be a member of many groups not to only Primary group

# Here in /home/username we can provide any name for users home directory such as /home/unclejipanipiladijiye and this will be home directory for the user

$ sudo useradd -u 1234 -d /home/username -m -s /bin/bash -c "Usernames Accounti" Username
