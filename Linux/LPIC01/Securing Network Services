We use xinetd for this types of operation.
we had something called inetd which was replaced by xinetd.it is a security daemon.
Which is located at /etc/xinetd.conf   [includedir]

If it is not installed already install it using
$ sudo apt install xinetd

More services running invites more hackers...!!!

This all has become old now. Nowdays in systemd systems we have something called unit files which we use instead of directly using services.
This is located at /etc/systemd/system
