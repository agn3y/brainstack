X use client-server model
it includes a graphical display
X11 is latest version of the X org Project

PART 1: What is “X”?
- "X" is short for the X Window System.
- It's not an operating system, and it's not a desktop environment like GNOME or KDE.
- It's just a system that makes graphics (windows) appear on your screen and connects keyboard/mouse to programs.

Think of X as a translator between:

- Your apps (like Firefox, Terminal)
- Your monitor
- Your mouse and keyboard

What does X really do?

 When you:
1. Open Firefox
2. Move your mouse
3. Type on the keyboard
4. Resize a window

X is handling all of that behind the scenes.

It does:

Drawing the windows
Tracking mouse movement
Handling keyboard typing
Sending that input to the right app

But it does not create the GUI buttons or icons — your desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.) handles that.

PART 2: What is “X11”?

X11 = Version 11 of the X Window System.
- First version: early 1980s
- X11 is the current and most used version
- It is a protocol, meaning it defines how X clients (apps) and X servers (screen managers) communicate.

So:

X = system
X11 = rules (protocol) used in that system

How does it work together?

1. X Server
- Controls screen, keyboard, mouse
- Runs on your machine
- Receives requests from apps like:
* “Draw a window here”
* “Resize that window”

2. X Client
- The app that wants to show something (Firefox, terminal)
- Sends requests to the X server using the X11 protocol
- Also receives input from the X server

3. Window Manager or Desktop Environment
- Adds decorations (title bar, close button)
- Manages window positions and focus
- Examples: GNOME, KDE, XFCE, i3

You launch xterm (terminal app):

1. xterm is the X client
2. It sends a request: “Hey X server, give me a 500x300 window!”
3. X server says “Sure!” and draws the window on your screen.
4. You move your mouse → X server sends that info to xterm
5. You type → X server gives keystrokes to xterm
6. You click close → Window manager tells X server to remove it

How does it work together?
Let’s say you open a terminal:

Terminal (X client) sends request to draw a window.

X Server receives that and draws it on your screen.

When you type or move mouse, X Server captures that.

X Server sends the input back to the terminal app.

What else is needed for full GUI?
X alone is not enough. You also need:

Window Manager (like Openbox, i3, etc.)
Controls window borders, resizing, moving.

Desktop Environment (like GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
Gives panels, icons, menus, wallpaper, etc.

[*] Local vs Remote

You can run apps on one machine and see them on another.

For example:
$ ssh -X user@remote
$ gedit

- gedit runs on the remote machine.
- But the X Server is on your local machine (your monitor).
- Remote app talks back to your local X server using the X11 protocol over SSH.

Internals (For deep understanding):
Data flow:

Keyboard/mouse input
        ↓
     X Server
        ↓
     X Client (App)
        ↓
     App wants to show output
        ↓
     Sends "draw request" to X Server
        ↓
     X Server draws pixels on screen

Summary Table

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part			Role					Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X			The display system			Manages drawing/input
X11			Protocol for communication		Defines how apps talk to X
X Server		Talks to hardware (screen, input)	Xorg or Wayland
X Client		App that shows GUI			Firefox, Terminal
Window Manager		Controls windows			i3, Metacity
Desktop Environment	Full GUI system				GNOME, KDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary in Simple Words:

X or X11 lets Linux show graphics (windows, mouse).
It separates display (X Server) from apps (X Clients).
It needs Window Manager + Desktop Environment for full GUI.
X11 is the engine; Desktop Environment is the car body.
