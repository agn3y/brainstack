[*] What is Wayland?
- Wayland is a new display system that tries to replace X11 (also known as Xorg or X Window System).

[*] Main Differences

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature						X11 (Xorg)							Wayland
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture				Client → X Server → Display			Client → Direct to Display (no middleman)
Rendering					Server-side + Client-side			Only client-side rendering
Speed						Slower due to middleman				Faster (lower latency)
Security					Less secure							More secure (but depends on compositor)
Network Support				Yes, built-in						No built-in remote display (yet)
Compatibility				Works with old apps					Many older apps may not work properly
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[*] Why People Still Use X11?

1. Old Applications
- Many old apps, toolkits, and games are built for X11.

2. Better Remote Access
- X11 supports remote desktop over SSH using DISPLAY. Wayland doesn't support this easily.

3. Driver Compatibility
- Some graphics drivers (especially from NVIDIA) work better with X11.

4. Window Managers
- Some popular desktop environments (like XFCE) work better or only with X11.

[*] Why Use Wayland?

1. Modern Design
- It's cleaner, simpler, and designed for current systems.

2. Low Latency
- It gives better performance on local systems.

3. Less Code
- Easier to maintain and debug.

[*] About WAYLAND_DISPLAY and DISPLAY

- DISPLAY=:0 → Used by X11 to know where to send the graphics.
- WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 → Same idea, used in Wayland.

[*] Summary in Simple Words

- X11 is old but stable, works everywhere, especially over network or with old software.
- Wayland is new and clean, good for local use with modern software.
- Right now, both are used, but Wayland is slowly replacing X11.
