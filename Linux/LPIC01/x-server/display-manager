A Display Manager is the program that shows you the login screen when your system starts.

It lets you:

1. Choose your username
2. Enter your password
3. Pick your Desktop Environment (like GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
4. Then it starts your graphical session

GDM	GNOME
SDDM	KDE Plasma
LightDM	XFCE, MATE, others
LXDM	LXDE
XDM	Very basic, old X11
---------------------------

How It Works Step-by-Step

1. System boots up
2. Display manager starts (gdm, sddm, etc.)
3. It shows you the GUI login screen
4. You log in
5. It starts the X Server (if not already running)
6. Then it starts your Window Manager + Desktop Environment

Display Manager vs X Server vs Desktop

-------------------------------------------------------------
Part			What it does
-------------------------------------------------------------
Display Manager		Login screen and user session control
X Server		Draws things on screen, handles input
Desktop Environment	Your desktop (icons, panels, apps)
-------------------------------------------------------------

In Simple Words:

Display Manager 	= Login gate
X Server 		= Drawing engine
Desktop Environment 	= Your room after login
