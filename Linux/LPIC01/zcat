What does zcat do?

zcat reads and displays the content of compressed .gz files without uncompressing them on disk.
It works just like cat, but for .gz files.

You can use zcat on any .gz file:

$ zcat file.txt.gz      # works (text file)
$ zcat script.sh.gz     # works (shell script)
$ zcat data.csv.gz      # works (CSV file)
$ zcat file.gz 

there are compression method which is called bzip2

$ bzip2 "file"

and to view it we can use 

$ bzcat "filename.bz2"

There is a newer format xzip

$ xz filename

and to see it

$ xzcat filename
