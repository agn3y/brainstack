The /dev directory contains special files that represent hardware devices and virtual devices in your system.

In Linux, everything is a file â€” even your hardware.

So your keyboard, hard disk, USB stick, etc. all have a file inside /dev.

These files let software talk to the hardware

For example:

When a program writes to /dev/sda, it's writing to your hard disk.

Reading from /dev/tty gets input from your terminal.

Writing to /dev/null throws data away (like a trash can).
