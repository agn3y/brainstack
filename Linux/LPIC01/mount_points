We already learned about mounting and their respective directory which are /media and /mnt. though, we can mount our disk anywhere we want but it will raise security concerns and
it is also not recommended

the command that we can use to mount a fs or drive is

$ man mount 
$ mount

we can see information about that at 

$ cat /proc/mounts
