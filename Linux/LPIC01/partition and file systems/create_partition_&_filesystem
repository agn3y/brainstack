Tool for partitioning

[1] partitioning using fdisk tool :

$ fdisk -l			# list partition table for specified device and then exit

 *  -  Means that it is a bootable sector
 
Example of using fdisk:

$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

the [ n ] and then [ w ]

Note :

- fdisk is an older tool and it only supports MBR (Master Boot Record) partition tables.


[2] mark partition with particular file system :

$ ls -l /sbin | grep "mkfs"			# list all mkfs system

Example :

$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1


[3] deleteing partition created with fdisk

$ fdisk /dev/sdb1		# for example we have used sbd1 

the n press [ d ] it will be deleted and then [ w ] to write


[4] modiify already created partition :

$ fdisk /dev/sdc1

first use [ l ] to list partition list and get code for each type

then use [ t ] and number of that partition.
suppose in my case it is [ 86 ] and the  [ w ].


[5] to create a swap partition 

$ fdisk /dev/sbd1		# create a partition then use
$ sudo mkswap /dev/sdb1		# marks it as a swap partition

then 

$ swapon			# to start using swap
$ swapon /dev/sdb1	`	# start using this partition as a swap memory
