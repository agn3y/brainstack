📦 Mounting and Unmounting Partitions in Linux

Step 1: Check Available Partitions

This command lists all partitions along with their filesystems, UUIDs, mount points, and labels.
$ lsblk -f

Step 2: Mounting a Partition

Mount using device name:
$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdc1 /your/target/directory

Mount using UUID:
$ sudo mount -U "UUID" /your/target/directory

Step 3: Unmounting a Partition

Unmount using device name:
$ sudo umount /dev/sdc1

Unmount using mount path:
$ sudo umount /your/target/directory

[⚠]Important:
These changes are temporary. After a system reboot, mounted partitions will be lost unless configured to auto-mount.

📁 Auto-Mount with /etc/fstab

When the system boots (regardless of the bootloader, e.g., GRUB or LILO), the root filesystem is mounted first. Then, the system runs:
This command mounts all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab, except those marked with noauto.
$ mount -a

✍️ /etc/fstab Format (Fields):

<file_system> <mount_point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>

new entry :
/dev/sdc1   /home/agn3y/mount ext3 default 0 0

1. dump

Used by the dump backup utility.

0 = Ignore (no backup).
1 = Backup enabled.

2. pass

Used by fsck to decide the order of filesystem checks during boot.
0 = Do not check.
1 = First priority (usually / root filesystem).
2 = Checked after the root filesystem.

tune2fs and Filesystem Check Frequency

Use tune2fs to set how often fsck checks a filesystem:
$ sudo tune2fs -c <mount_count> -i <interval> /dev/sdXn

Example:

Checks every 10 mounts or every 7 days, whichever comes first.
$ sudo tune2fs -c 10 -i 7d /dev/sdc1

[⚙️] Common Mount Options

defaults → Uses default settings: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async
noauto → Will not mount automatically with mount -a

user → Allows non-root users to mount
nouser → Only root can mount (default)
ro → Mount as read-only
rw → Mount as read-write
