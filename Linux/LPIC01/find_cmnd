We can use find to find file based on name, permission ,size, type or modified by date

By Name
$ find /path -name "filename"
$ find experimental/ -name "[fF]ile[1-4].txt" 		#  performed in system

By Permission
$ find /path -perm mode
$ find / -perm 0777       #  files with 777 permission 

By Size
$ find /path -size +1M
$ find / -size +100M      # files bigger than 100MB

By Type

f = file
d = directory

$ find /path -type f   # for files
$ find /path -type d   # for directories
$ find /etc -type d

By Modified Date
$ find /path -mtime -n
# -n means within last n days
# +n means more than n days ago

$ find /home/shun -mtime -2 	# file modified 2 days ago
