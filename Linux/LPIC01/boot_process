Full Linux Boot Process (Step-by-Step with POST)

0. POST (Power-On Self-Test)

Happens right after you power on.
Done by BIOS/UEFI firmware.

Checks hardware: CPU, RAM, keyboard, etc.

If everything is okay, it moves to the boot device (like SSD or USB).

1. BIOS / UEFI

Low-level software on your motherboard.

Chooses the boot device (like HDD, SSD).

Hands over control to the bootloader.

BIOS = older
UEFI = modern and more powerful

2. Bootloader (like GRUB)

Loads and runs the Linux kernel file from disk.

Also loads initrd (temporary root filesystem for early setup).

3. Kernel

Loaded into RAM.

Initializes:

Memory
CPUs
Drivers (for storage, USB, etc.)

Mounts the root file system.

Starts the first process: init or systemd

4. init / systemd (PID 1)

Manages all startup services.

Starts:

Network
Display Manager
Logging
File mounting

➡️ It decides the mode of the system (CLI or GUI)

5. Runlevel / systemd Target

Defines system type:

multi-user.target = no GUI (server style)

graphical.target = with GUI (desktop)

6. Login Prompt

You get terminal or desktop screen.

After login, you can use your system.
