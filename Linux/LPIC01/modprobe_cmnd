modprobe is a command to:

Load a driver (module) into the Linux kernel
Remove a driver (module) from the Linux kernel

Think of modules like plugins for your system. If you need support for USB or Wi-Fi, Linux uses a module (driver). modprobe turns that support on or off.

To Load a Module (plug it in):

$ sudo modprobe usb_storage

* This tells the system : "Hey, I want USB storage support!"

* To Remove a Module (unplug it):

$ sudo modprobe -r usb_storage

* This tells the system : "Okay, I don’t need that USB driver anymore."

* How to Know if It's Loaded?

$ lsmod | grep usb_storage

If it shows up = it's loaded.

If not = it’s not loaded.

* Real-World Example

You plug in a USB drive → Linux tries to auto-load usb_storage.

But if it doesn't work, you can do:

$ sudo modprobe usb_storage

Boom — now your USB should work. To Load a Module (plug it in):

$ sudo modprobe usb_storage

* This tells the system:

"Hey, I want USB storage support!"

* To Remove a Module (unplug it):

$ sudo modprobe -r usb_storage

* This tells the system:

"Okay, I don’t need that USB driver anymore."

* How to Know if It's Loaded?

$ lsmod | grep usb_storage

If it shows up = it's loaded.

If not = it’s not loaded.
