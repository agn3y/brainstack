All the modern linux systems runs on Systemd

we have $ systemctl command for to control utilities 

What is systemd?

systemd is a program in Linux that manages how the system starts and controls services (like a web server, database, etc.). It's the first thing that runs after the Linux kernel boots up.

Think of it like the main controller of your Linux system.

Simple Example:

Letâ€™s say your computer is a restaurant.

systemd is the manager.
When the restaurant opens (computer boots), the manager:

Turns on the lights (starts the display service)
Starts the kitchen (starts the database service)
Opens the door (starts the network)
Keeps checking if everything is working
Can restart or stop anything if there is a problem

What can systemd do?

Here are some simple things you can do with systemd:

Start a service:

sudo systemctl start nginx

Stop a service:
sudo systemctl stop nginx

Restart a service:

sudo systemctl restart nginx

Check if a service is running:

sudo systemctl status nginx

Make a service start automatically on boot:

sudo systemctl enable nginx

Stop a service from starting at boot:

sudo systemctl disable nginx

What is a unit file?

A unit file is a small file that tells systemd how to run a service.

For example, the file nginx.service tells systemd:

How to start nginx

When to start it

What to do if it crashes

These files are usually stored in:

/etc/systemd/system/

/lib/systemd/system/

Why use systemd?

Before systemd, Linux used older systems like SysVinit. They were slower and harder to manage. systemd is:

Faster to boot

Easier to use

Can restart services if they crash

Better at handling many things at once
