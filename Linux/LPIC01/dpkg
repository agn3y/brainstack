DPKG - debian binary package

$ cd /var/cache/apt/archives

🧱 What is dpkg?

dpkg stands for Debian Package.
It is the basic tool used in Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu, Kali Linux) to manage .deb files (Debian software packages).

Think of .deb like a zip file that contains a software app.

dpkg is low-level. That means it works directly with .deb files.
It does not automatically download packages or handle dependencies like apt does.

✅ Basic dpkg Commands

1. 📦 Install a .deb package

You need to download the .deb file first.

$ sudo dpkg -i filename.deb

Example:

$ sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

2. ❌ Remove a package

$ sudo dpkg -r packagename

Example:

$ sudo dpkg -r google-chrome-stable

Note: This removes the software but keeps config files.

3. ❌ Remove completely (with config files)

$ sudo dpkg -P packagename

4. 📃 List all installed packages

$ dpkg -l

You can scroll through or use grep to find something:

$ dpkg -l | grep chrome

5. 🧾 Check details of a specific package

$ dpkg -s packagename

This shows version, description, status, etc.

6. 📁 List files installed by a package

$ dpkg -L packagename

It shows all the files and where they are installed on your system.

7. 🔍 Find which package owns a file

$ dpkg -S /path/to/file

🔧 Fixing broken installs

Sometimes, dpkg gives errors about missing dependencies. You can fix them with:

$ sudo apt -f install

This tells apt to fix and install the missing stuff.
