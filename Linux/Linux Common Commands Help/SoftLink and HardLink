crete a softlink using

ln = Hard Link

Creates a direct reference to the data on disk.

Hard link:

Works only within the same partition

Shares the same inode

If you delete the original file, the hard link still works

You just lose one name, but the file data stays

ln -s = Soft (Symbolic) Link

Creates a shortcut or reference to the path.

Soft link:

Can link across partitions or drives

Has a different inode

If you delete the original file, the soft link breaks (shows as “broken link”)


Note : 

Hard Links works within same partitions

WHen we remove source file soft link will also be gone however for hardlink it will not be gone and will have the same content what we used to had in deleted file
