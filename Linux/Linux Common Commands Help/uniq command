What does uniq do?

it is best practise to use uniq with sort

$ sort filename | uniq 
$ sort filename | uniq -c

uniq removes duplicate lines from a file — but only if the duplicates are next to each other (very important!).

Example:

Suppose names.txt has:

shun
shun
agney
agney
zara
shun
If you run:

uniq names.txt

Output:

shun
agney
zara
shun

Wait… why didn’t it remove the last shun?

Because uniq only removes repeated lines that are side-by-side.

How to fix this?

Sort first, then uniq:

sort names.txt | uniq

Now output:

agney
shun
zara
Perfect! ✔️
