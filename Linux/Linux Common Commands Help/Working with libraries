[*] Check Installed Libraries in MX Linux

To list all installed libraries (shared object files - .so), run:

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep -E 'lib.*'

Or, if you want a more detailed list with versions:

$ dpkg -l | grep -E '^ii' | grep -i lib

[*] Find Unused (Not Needed) Libraries

To check for unused libraries that are no longer needed, run:

$ sudo apt autoremove --dry-run

[*] Uninstall Unused Libraries

If the previous command lists unused libraries, remove them by running:

sudo apt autoremove -y

[*] Manually Remove Specific Libraries

If you want to remove a specific library, first check its package name:

$ dpkg -l | grep libssl

Then, remove it using:

$ sudo apt remove --purge libssl3{#package name} -y

[*] Clean Up System (Optional)

After uninstalling libraries, free up space by running:

$ sudo apt clean
