how to use find

$ find / -name Hulk.txt

how to use locate 

$ locate Hulk.txt

Data reported by Locate as not as fresh as find beacuse linux system creates snapshot of system and locate use that to quickly report back. if there are any changes done it will be reported after the next snapshot is created, thats why. Inshort, Find is more reliable

to update the database of snapshot we use

$updatedb
