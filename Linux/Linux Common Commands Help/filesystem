Linux File Hierarchy (Filesystem Structure)
The Linux filesystem is organized as a single tree with the root directory / at the top. Everything — files, directories, devices, processes — exists under this root.

🔰 1. / — Root Directory
Top-most directory of the Linux system.

Every single file and directory starts from here.

You can think of it as the "main hard disk folder".

📁 2. /bin — Essential User Binaries
Stores basic commands needed for system operation.

Available to all users, even in single-user mode.

Examples:

ls – list files

cp – copy files

mv – move/rename files

rm – delete files

cat, echo, grep

✅ If /bin is missing, the system won’t even boot properly.

📁 3. /boot — Boot Loader Files
Contains boot-related files:

Linux kernel (vmlinuz)

Initial RAM disk (initrd)

GRUB bootloader files

Without this, the system can’t start.

🧠 Think of it like the BIOS helper folder for Linux.

📁 4. /dev — Device Files
Contains special files for all hardware devices.

Devices are treated as files in Linux.

Example: /dev/sda – first hard disk

/dev/tty – terminal

/dev/null – data sink

⛓️ Linux uses the concept of "everything is a file" here.

📁 5. /etc — Configuration Files
Stores all system-wide config files.

Example:

/etc/passwd – user accounts

/etc/fstab – disk mount settings

/etc/hostname – system name

/etc/network/ – network settings

⚠️ Do not delete anything here — very important for system working.

📁 6. /home — User Home Directories
Stores personal files for each user.

Like C:\Users\ in Windows.

/home/shun → your personal folder

Each user has:

Desktop, Downloads, Documents, etc.

📁 7. /lib and /lib64 — Libraries
Contains shared libraries needed by /bin and /sbin programs.

Like .dll files in Windows.

/lib64 is for 64-bit systems.

Example:

/lib/libc.so.6 – C standard library.

📁 8. /media — Removable Media
Temporary mount point for external devices:

USB drives

DVDs

Memory cards

When you plug in a USB, it may appear as:

/media/shun/USB_DRIVE_NAME

📁 9. /mnt — Temporary Mount Directory
Used by sysadmins to manually mount filesystems.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
Use it when you want to access extra drives manually.

📁 10. /opt — Optional Software Packages
Stores optional or third-party apps.

Example: commercial software or games you install manually.

Each package often gets its own directory:

/opt/google/ or /opt/skype/

📁 11. /proc — Process Info (Virtual Filesystem)
Special directory — contains info about running processes.

Example:

/proc/1 – info about process ID 1 (usually systemd)

/proc/cpuinfo – info about your CPU

/proc/meminfo – memory usage

🚫 Not a real directory — it’s created in memory by the kernel.

📁 12. /root — Root User’s Home
Home directory for the root user (admin).

Not to be confused with /.

Example: root's personal files → /root/.bashrc

📁 13. /run — Runtime Information
Stores data about system since last boot.

Used by programs and system services to keep state info.

Example: network status, process IDs.

🧠 It replaces older folders like /var/run.

📁 14. /sbin — System Binaries
Like /bin, but for admin-level (root-only) commands.

Examples:

fsck – check filesystems

reboot, shutdown

ifconfig, iptables

🛠️ Usually used during system maintenance.

📁 15. /srv — Service Data
"srv" = service

Used by server programs like:

Web server (e.g., /srv/www)

FTP server

Stores the data that services serve.

📁 16. /sys — Kernel and Device Info (Virtual)
Like /proc, this is a virtual filesystem.

Contains data about hardware and kernel settings.

Example:

/sys/class/net/ – info about network interfaces

Mostly used by the system and hardware tools.

📁 17. /tmp — Temporary Files
For temporary files created by programs.

Auto-deleted after reboot or time period.

Examples:

Temporary download files

App installation temps

🚫 Don’t store important data here!

📁 18. /usr — User Programs and Data
Largest folder usually.

Contains programs, docs, and data for users (not admin).

Subdirectories:

/usr/bin – most user commands

/usr/lib – app libraries

/usr/share – icons, help files, man pages

🧠 Think of it like a read-only "Program Files" in Windows.

📁 19. /var — Variable Files
Contains files that change often:

Logs → /var/log/

Print jobs → /var/spool/

Mail → /var/mail/

Caches → /var/cache
