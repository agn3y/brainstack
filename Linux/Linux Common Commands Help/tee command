What is tee command?

tee is a Linux command used to:

read from standard input (keyboard or output of a command) and write the input to both:

terminal (screen)

a file 

Basic Syntax:

command | tee filename

Example 1 – Save output to file and see it on screen:

echo "Hello Shun" | tee output.txt

Show Hello Shun on the screen

Save Hello Shun inside a file called output.txt

Example 2 – Use with a real command:

ls -l | tee list.txt

Show the list of files (ls -l) on screen

Save the same list into list.txt

Append instead of overwrite:

echo "Another line" | tee -a output.txt

-a means append (add to the file)

Without -a, it will overwrite the file
