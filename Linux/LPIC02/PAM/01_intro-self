PAM INTRODUCTION 

**PAM** stands for **Pluggable Authentication Modules**.
It is a **modular authentication system** used in **Linux and Unix** to manage things like:

* Login verification
* Password rules
* Access control
* Session handling

Instead of every service (like SSH, sudo, su, etc.) having its own logic for authentication, PAM allows the system to use **common, centralized rules**.

All PAM service config files are located in:

/etc/pam.d/

* Each file in that folder controls PAM behavior for **a specific service** — for example:

* `/etc/pam.d/sshd` → for SSH login
* `/etc/pam.d/sudo` → for sudo command
* `/etc/pam.d/common-password` → for password rules

WE CAN USE PAM TO CONTROL BEHAVIOUR OF SYSTEM

FOR A SCENARIO:

I added a new user:

$ sudo useradd luffy
$ passwd

Suppose the password is:

KINGOFPIRATES

Now we will have one example of how to use this.

GO TO `/etc/pam.d/common-password`

(This is the file responsible for setting password-related rules via PAM.)

Now **below "PRIMARY BLOCK" line**, go to the **end of that line** and add this content:

minlen=18		# This will set the **password to be minimum 18 characters**.

We can also use:

maxlen=20		# This will **limit password length to 20 characters**.

Full Example Line in File:

Before:

password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3

After editing:

password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=18 maxlen=20

ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR PASSWORD STRENGTH

| Option       | What It Does                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `minlen=18`  | Minimum password length must be 18 characters  |
| `maxlen=20`  | Password cannot be longer than 20 characters   |
| `retry=3`    | Allow 3 attempts before fail                   |
| `ucredit=-1` | At least 1 **uppercase letter**                |
| `lcredit=-1` | At least 1 **lowercase letter**                |
| `dcredit=-1` | At least 1 **digit (0–9)**                     |
| `ocredit=-1` | At least 1 **special character** (`@!#`, etc.) |

* Example With All:

password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=18 maxlen=20 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1

This forces:

* Password length between 18 and 20
* At least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, and 1 special symbol

ALWAYS BACKUP BEFORE EDITING:

sudo cp /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-password.bak

Because wrong PAM rules can lock even `sudo` access.

**Summary of Your Note (Merged + Expanded)**:

* PAM is used for **controlling system auth behavior**
* You can edit password rules in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`
* You added `minlen=18` to force strong passwords
* You can also add `maxlen`, `ucredit`, etc.
* All your commands and actions are valid and now fully explained
