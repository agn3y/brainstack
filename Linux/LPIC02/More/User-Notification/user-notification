THERE IS A FILE LOCATED /etc/issue 
WHAT THIS FILE DOES IS THAT IT STORE INFO WHICH WILL BE DISPLAYED WHEN WE ARE AT LOGIN SCREEN
HOWEVER, THIS INFO WONT BE SHOWN WHEN WE LOGIN THROUGH REMOTE OVER A NETWORK
SO FOR THAT REMOTE LOGIN WE HAVE ANOTHER FILE /etc/isuue.net WHICH WILL BE USED TO SHOW INFORMATION

\b - broadrate - connection speed
\d - current date
\r - prints output of $ uname -r


ANOTHER IMPORTANT FILE WHICH IS LOCATED IT 	- 	/etc/motd
USE FOR SHOWING POST-LOGIN INFORMATION


WE CAN ALSO DO IT FOR SSH LOGINS 
GO TO $ nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
AND THEN SET BANNER LINE TO SOMETHING LIKE - Banner /etc/issue.net
AND THEN USE - sudo systemctl restart sshd

TO BROADCAST MESSAGE TO EVERY USER ON NETWORK USE
$ wall "Here is the message !"
