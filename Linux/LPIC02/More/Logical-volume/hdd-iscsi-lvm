[*] DMA – Direct Memory Access
- What: 	Allows devices (like HDD) to directly access RAM without CPU.
- Why: 		Speeds up data transfer and reduces CPU load.
- Control:  Enabled/disabled by the kernel.

[*] IDE, PATA, SATA – Storage Technologies
- IDE	 Integrated Drive Electronics	Uses ATA (Advanced Tech Attachment)
- PATA	 Parallel ATA (older IDE drives)	Uses ribbon cables, slower
- SATA	 Serial ATA (modern drives)	Faster, now common in most systems

- If device is /dev/hda1 → h = IDE/PATA device
- If device is /dev/sda1 → s = SATA or SCSI-based device

[*] Useful Tools

[*] hdparm
- Works for IDE/SATA drives.
$ sudo hdparm -d 0 /dev/sda    # Turn OFF DMA  
$ sudo hdparm -d 1 /dev/sda    # Turn ON DMA

[*] sdparm
- Works for SCSI/SATA drives.

[*] Kernel and Drive Control Paths
- /dev					All device files (e.g. drives)
- /proc/sys/kernel/		Kernel behavior config

[*] You can view or change kernel settings using:
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/...

[*] SCSI – Small Computer System Interface
- What: An older standard to connect storage devices (like hard drives, USBs) to a computer.
- Type: Mostly physical connection.
- Each SCSI device has a LUN (Logical Unit Number) – like a unique ID.

--------------------------
[*] iSCSI – Internet SCSI
--------------------------
- What: A modern version of SCSI that works over a network (TCP/IP).
- Use: Connects remote storage like it’s a local hard disk.
- How: Sends SCSI commands over the internet/local network.

-------------------------
[*] iSCSI Setup in Linux
-------------------------

1. Install the Client
$ sudo apt install open-iscsi

2. Discover iSCSI Target (Server)
$ iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p 192.168.0.99

-m discovery: mode
-t st: type = send targets
-p: IP address of iSCSI target (example: 192.168.0.99)

3. Config File
$ /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf

[*] LVM – Logical Volume Manager
--------------------------------
- LVM lets you manage storage more flexibly than traditional partitions.

Main Parts of LVM

PV		Physical Volume		Real storage device (like a 3 GB hard drive)		/dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1
VG		Volume Group		Combines multiple PVs into one big storage pool		3×3 GB = 9 GB VG
LV		Logical Volume		Virtual partitions made from VG	You can create 		2×4.5 GB LVs

Think of it like:

PVs = Bricks
VG = Wall built using bricks
LVs = Windows cut out of the wall

[*] Basic LVM Commands

# Make a physical volume
$ sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

# Create a volume group from PVs
$ sudo vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1

# Create logical volume (e.g., 7.5 GB)
$ sudo lvcreate -L 7.5G -n my_lv my_vg

# Format and mount the LV
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
$ sudo mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt
