- Efficient with sysvinit systems
- init systems operate in linear fashion
- if linear which process should start first
- in 
[1] redhat - /etc/rc.d/ 
--> {1} rc.sysinit (a kind of bash script which loads system...)
- do mount systems
- RAID devices
- LVM
- start system services
--> {2} rc 
- we can say it somehow use inittab file to load system in default runlevel
- there are dir which are located in rc.d where there are more dir according to run level which contains file for os to be loaded in runlevel, kinda symlink
- if sylink start with {s-start and k-kill} process [ exp k9enginx - k for kill , 9 is number os process to be started in linear process ]

[2] debian - /etc/init.d/

- DO NOT RENAME OR MESS AROUND WITH THIS SYMLINK THAT WILL CAUSE ISSUE HARD TO CORRECT.
