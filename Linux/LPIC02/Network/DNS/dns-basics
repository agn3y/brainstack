DNS (Domain Name System) - Levels & Request Journey

DNS converts a domain name like `www.google.com` to an IP address like `142.250.195.68`.

DNS Levels (Hierarchy)


                          [ . ]  <== Root DNS Server
                          / \
                         /   \
                    [com]   [org]  <== TLD Servers
                       |
                 [google.com]  <== Authoritative DNS Server


1. **Root DNS Server** (`.`)

* Top-level of DNS.
* Knows where `.com`, `.org`, `.net` servers are.
* Doesnâ€™t know website IP, only tells which TLD to go to.

2. **TLD DNS Server** (Top Level Domain)

* `.com`, `.org`, `.in`, etc.
* Knows where the **authoritative DNS** is for that domain.

3. **Authoritative DNS Server**

* This server **has the real IP address** of the domain.
* Example: Knows IP of `google.com`.

How DNS Request Travels

Suppose you type `www.google.com` in browser.

Step-by-step flow:

[1] Browser â†’ Local DNS Cache
   ðŸ”¹ If found, return IP. If not, ask OS resolver.

[2] Resolver â†’ Root DNS Server (.)
   ðŸ”¹ Asks: "Where is .com DNS?"

[3] Root â†’ TLD Server (.com)
   ðŸ”¹ Says: "Go to .com DNS"

[4] TLD â†’ Authoritative DNS for google.com
   ðŸ”¹ Says: "Ask google.com DNS"

[5] Authoritative DNS â†’ Resolver
   ðŸ”¹ Says: "IP is 142.250.195.68"

[6] Resolver â†’ Browser
   ðŸ”¹ Gives back IP to browser

[7] Browser â†’ Sends request to 142.250.195.68 (Google)

Extra Notes

* **Local DNS Cache**: Speeds up repeat visits.
* **Recursive Resolver**: Does the full lookup for you.
* **TTL (Time to Live)**: How long to keep DNS info in cache.
* **CDN and Load Balancers**: Sometimes give different IPs based on location.

Real World Example:

You enter `www.youtube.com` in browser:

1. Check cache â€“ not found
2. Ask root server â€“ go to `.com`
3. Ask `.com` TLD â€“ go to `youtube.com` DNS
4. Get real IP â€“ e.g., `142.250.80.78`
5. Load website using that IP
