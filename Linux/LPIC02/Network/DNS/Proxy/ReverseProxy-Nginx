Reverse Proxy Using NGINX
- A reverse proxy is a middleman between the user and the actual server, but it is set up on the server side.
- A reverse proxy is a middleman between the user and the actual server.

* It is set up on the **server-side**, not on the client-side.
* It helps in:
  * Load balancing
  * Improving efficiency
  * Hiding the real server from the outside world

* Install NGINX

$ sudo apt install nginx -y


* Important File Locations

* Configuration file:
  `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

* Web root directory:
  `/var/www/html`

* Another possible location for web files:
  `/usr/share/nginx`

* Configure NGINX as a Reverse Proxy

Step 1: Open the configuration file
$ sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Step 2: Add the following inside the `http` block


server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.0.100;		# add proxy domain or ip
    }
}


Explanation:

* `listen 80` — tells NGINX to listen on port 80 (HTTP)
* `proxy_pass` — forwards requests to the actual server at IP `192.168.0.100`

Restart NGINX
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
