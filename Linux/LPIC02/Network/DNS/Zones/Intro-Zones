DNS Zones – Introduction

What is a DNS Zone?
- A **DNS Zone** is a part of the DNS system that contains a portion of the domain name space and is managed by a specific DNS server.
- It's like a **container** that holds DNS records (A, MX, NS, etc.) for a domain or subdomain.

Why Create Zones?

We use zones to:
* Store and manage **DNS records** (locally)
* **Cache** information from other DNS servers
* **Respond faster** to repeated queries
* Reduce external DNS traffic
* When we cache DNS data from another server — that's called **creating a zone**.

Types of DNS Zones

| Zone Type             | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary (Master)**  | Stores original DNS records (read/write)               |
| **Secondary (Slave)** | Gets a copy of records from primary (read-only)        |
| **Caching-Only**      | Doesn’t hold original records, only caches from others |
| **Forward Zone**      | Used to resolve domain names → IP                      |
| **Reverse Zone**      | Used to resolve IP → domain names                      |

Files Related to Zones in BIND

| File                         | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `/etc/bind/named.conf`       | Main BIND config file                    |
| `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` | Add zone definitions (primary/secondary) |
| `/etc/bind/db.domain.com`    | Zone data file (holds records)           |
| `/etc/bind/db.192`           | Reverse zone data file                   |

Example Zone Entry in `named.conf.local`

zone "example.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
};

Summary

* DNS Zones help organize and store DNS data
* Zones can cache data for **faster performance**
* Primary = holds original records
* Secondary = copy of primary
* Caching-only = stores only what it queries
* Configured in BIND using zone blocks
