Split DNS?

Split DNS (Split-Horizon DNS) is when a DNS server **resolves domain names differently** based on **who is making the request**:

* üîí **Internal users** (inside organization) get **private IPs**
* üåê **External users** (outside world) get **public IPs**

Why is Split DNS Needed?

| Need                            | Reason                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Security                        | Hide internal systems from the public                                 |
| Performance                     | Route internal users to faster, private resources                     |
| Access Control                  | Let internal users access different servers or services               |
| Same domain, different views    | Use `example.com` for both inside and outside, but give different IPs |


Google.com Example

Google uses Split DNS to serve users efficiently.

| User Type                 | What They See                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You at Home               | `google.com` ‚Üí **Public IP** (like `142.250.70.46`)                                |
| Google Employee in Office | `google.com` ‚Üí **Private IP** (like `10.10.1.15`) for internal testing or services |

This helps Google:
* Reduce load on public systems
* Keep internal apps hidden
* Test features only inside office

How Split DNS Works (Basic View)

1. Two **zone files** are created for the same domain:

* One for **internal network** (served on internal interface)
* One for **external users** (served on external interface)

2. BIND or other DNS servers are configured with ACLs like:

# CONFIG STARTS FROM HERE

acl internal {
    192.168.0.0/24;
    localhost;
};

view "internal" {
    match-clients { internal; };
    zone "example.com" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.internal";
    };
}

view "external" {
    match-clients { any; };
    zone "example.com" {
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.external";
    };
}

Simple Use Case Example

Suppose your domain is `shunlab.com`:

| User            | DNS Reply                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Inside Home Lab | `shunlab.com ‚Üí 192.168.1.10` |
| Outside World   | `shunlab.com ‚Üí 45.55.66.77`  |


| Key Point           | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Split DNS           | Serves different DNS results to different users |
| Use Cases           | Security, speed, internal testing               |
| Tools               | BIND9, PowerDNS, dnsmasq                        |
| Main Config Element | `view` blocks and `match-clients` in BIND       |
