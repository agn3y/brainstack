Squid Proxy

* Forward Proxy setup server

- Control and monitor traffic  
- Improve security  
- Help with caching  
- Block or allow specific websites  
- Hide internal user IPs from outside  

* Situation:

- All users (wired or Wi-Fi) are on the **same network** (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
- You will install **Squid** on one Linux machine
- All clients will be configured to **send their traffic through the proxy**
- The proxy will then **forward requests** to the real internet

1. Install Squid on Proxy Server Machine

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install squid -y

2. Find Your Server's IP Address

$ ip a

Assume: `192.168.1.100` ← This is your **proxy server IP**

3. Configure Squid for LAN

$ sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf

Find and update these parts (or add new):

# Allow your LAN network
acl localnet src 192.168.1.0/24

# Allow access to proxy from localnet
http_access allow localnet

# Define the port proxy will listen on (default 3128)
http_port 3128

# SAVE - EXIT	

4. Restart Squid to Apply Changes

$ sudo systemctl restart squid
$ sudo systemctl enable squid

5. Configure Client Devices

On every device (Windows/Linux):

- Go to: **Control Panel > Internet Options > Connections > LAN Settings**
- Enable: **Use a proxy server**
- Address: `192.168.1.100`  
- Port: `3128`

Linux:

You can set proxy globally or in browsers:

export http_proxy="http://192.168.1.100:3128"
export https_proxy="http://192.168.1.100:3128"

Or configure browser (Firefox/Chrome) proxy settings manually.

* Test

Try to visit a website. If everything works — all traffic is now going through your proxy.
Check logs:

$ cat /var/log/squid/access.log

You’ll see each request being logged.

* Why This Is Safer?

- **IP masking**: Outside world only sees proxy IP
- **Block sites**: You can add rules to block social media, etc.
- **Monitor usage**: Log and analyze who accessed what
- **Filter content**: Only allow safe domains
