- Understanding ip Command: Modern Replacement for ifconfig, arp, and route
- The ip command is a powerful Linux networking tool that replaces older utilities like:
- ifconfig (interface configuration)
- arp (ARP cache management)
- route (routing table management)

* It provides a unified way to manage network settings with more features and better control.

1. Managing IP Addresses (Replaces ifconfig)
# Unlike ifconfig, this adds a secondary IP instead of replacing the existing one.
# Add an IP Address (Without Removing Existing Ones)
$ sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.50/24 dev enp0s3

To remove an IP, use:
$ sudo ip addr del 192.168.0.50/24 dev enp0s3

Enable/Disable Promiscuous Mode
# Used for network monitoring (e.g., packet sniffing).
$ sudo ip link set enp0s3 promisc on   # Enable
$ sudo ip link set enp0s3 promisc off  # Disable

2. Managing ARP Cache (Replaces arp)
# Useful if a device’s MAC changes but the cache is outdated.

- View ARP Cache (MAC ↔ IP Mappings)
$ ip neigh show

- Delete an ARP Entry
$ ip neigh del 192.168.0.51 dev enp0s3

3. Managing Routing Table (Replaces route)

- View Routing Table
$ ip route show

- Add a New Route
$ sudo ip route add 192.168.0.51/24 via 192.168.0.1
