# Topic: `lsof` Command in Linux

## 1. What is `lsof`?

- `lsof` stands for **List Open Files**.
- It is a command-line tool used to **show all files opened by processes**.
- In Linux, **everything is a file** â€” regular files, directories, sockets, pipes, devices, etc.
- So `lsof` helps to **inspect what files or ports are being used by which processes**.

## 2. Why is `lsof` used?

* To see **which process is using a file or port**
* To **find open network connections**
* To **troubleshoot "file in use" errors**
* To **check open ports and the owning process**
* To **identify processes using a directory or device**

## 3. Basic Syntax
$ lsof [options] [target]

## 4. Common Use Cases

### 4.1 Show All Open Files
$ lsof		# Shows a very long list of all open files on the system.

### 4.2 Show Open Files by a Specific User
$ lsof -u username

### 4.3 Find Which Process is Using a Specific File
$ lsof /path/to/file

### 4.4 Show Who is Using a Specific Port
$ lsof -i :80		# Shows which process is using TCP/UDP port 80.

### 4.5 Show All Network Connections
$ lsof -i		# Shows all open internet connections (TCP/UDP).

### 4.6 Show All TCP Connections
$ lsof -i tcp

### 4.7 Show All UDP Connections
$ lsof -i udp

### 4.8 Kill the Process Holding a File
$ kill -9 $(lsof -t /path/to/file)

* `-t`: Only show PIDs (no extra info)
* This command kills the process using the file

## 5. Common Options

| Option    | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `-i`      | Show network files (IP/ports)                    |
| `-u user` | Show files opened by a specific user             |
| `-p PID`  | Show files opened by a specific process          |
| `-t`      | Show only process IDs (used for scripting)       |
| `+D /dir` | Show all files opened in a directory recursively |
| `-nP`     | Disable DNS and port name resolution (faster)    |

## 6. Summary

* `lsof` lists all open files (including network sockets, pipes, devices, etc.)
* Very useful for debugging file locks and open ports
* Can help identify which process is using a port or file
* Often used together with `netstat` or `ss` for network debugging
