# Understanding the `route` Command and Routing Table

## What is the `route` command?
- The `route` command is a tool to view and modify your system's IP routing table. The routing table determines how network traffic is directed between your computer and other networks.

## Basic Usage

### Viewing the routing table
$ route -n
- This shows all current routes with IP addresses (no name resolution).


### Adding a route
$ sudo route add -net NETWORK_ADDRESS netmask SUBNET_MASK gw GATEWAY_IP

Example:
$ sudo route add -net 192.168.50.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1
- This means: "Send all traffic for 192.168.50.0-192.168.50.255 via the gateway at 192.168.0.1"

### Removing a route
$ sudo route del -net NETWORK_ADDRESS netmask SUBNET_MASK gw GATEWAY_IP

Example:
$ sudo route del -net 192.168.50.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.0.1
- This removes the specific route from the routing table.

## Key Points to Remember
- You need `sudo` because modifying routes requires administrator privileges
- The `-net` option specifies a network route (not a single host)
- `netmask` defines which IP addresses the route applies to
- `gw` specifies the gateway (router) that should handle this traffic

Note: On modern Linux systems, the `ip route` command is often preferred over `route`.
