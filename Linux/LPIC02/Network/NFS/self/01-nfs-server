INSTALL NFS PACKAGE FOR SERVER SIDE

STEP 01:
$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y

NEXT GO TO /etc/exports 

- MAIN CONFIG FILE
- HERE WE SPECIFY WHAT WE WANT TO SHARE
- WHO WE ARE GRANTING ACCESS TO
- PERMISSION ABOUT WHAT PARTICULAR CLIENT CAN DO
- WE CAN ALLOW PARTICULAR RANGE OF NETWORK SUCH AS 192.168.1.1 OR A DOMAIN SUCH AS CHODUCHAMAN.COM OR PARTICULAR USERGROUP
- NOW WHEN WE SHARE SOME FHS AT THE BOTH END FOR EXAMPLE CLIENT COMPUTER ALSO WILL HAVE ROOT USER AND ON THE OTHER HAND AT SERVERS SIDE ALSO WILL HAVE ROOT USER BUT SINCE AT THE SERVER USE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME LEVERAGE SINCE IT IS THE ONE SHARING FILE. SO TO MAKE THEM PREVENT FROM CLASHING THEIR PERMISSIONS WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED 
 roo_squash OPTIONS
- IT SQUASHES THE ABILITY OF CLIENT ROOT
- OR WE CAN LET CLIENT HAVE THE ABILITY OF ROOT USING no_root_squash ALL ACCESS AND FULL CONTROL

STEP 02:
- NOW ADD THE FOLLOWING CONTENT AT THE EOF 

/media/myshare	192.168.0.31(ro,root_squash) 192.168.50.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)

- HERE THIS CONFIGURE DESCRIBE THAT myshare HAS BEEN A SHARED FOLDER 
- 192.168.0.31 HAS ACCESS OF ro(read only) and root_squash(root permission stolen)
- ALSO 192.168.50.0 ALL 254 HOSTS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS SHARE

- WE CAN ALSO USE WILDCARD HERE SOMETHING LIKE

/media/myshare	*(rw,root_squash)	192.168.0.0/24		# EVERYONE WITHIN 192.168.0.0 HAS ACCESS


STEP 03:
- NOW CREATE THE DIRECTORY WE ARE SHARING DONT IF YOU HAVE IT ALREADY

$ su -
$ mkdir /media/myshare
$ sudo chmod 777 /media/myshare
$ sudo systemctl start nfs-kernel-server
$ sudo systemctl status nfs-kernel-server

STEP 04:
- USE THIS COMMAND WITH man
- $ man exportfs	# MANPAGE
- $ sudo exportfs
- $ sudo exportfs -r
- $ sudo exportfs 
- $ sudo showmount -e 192.168.0.32		# USE YOUR IP SINCE IT IS ALLOWED


STEP 05:
- LIST NFS STATISTICS
- $ man nfsstat 
- $ sudo nfsstat -s	# SERVER STATS 
- $ sudo nfsstat -c	# CLIENT STATS
