IMPORTANT NETWORK CONFIGURATION FILES IN LINUX

[1] `/ETC/HOSTS`
- USED TO MANUALLY MAP **HOSTNAMES TO IP ADDRESSES**.
- HELPS IN **DNS RESOLUTION** WHEN DNS SERVER IS NOT USED.
- EXAMPLE ENTRY:

8.8.8.8 CHODU.COM	# (THIS MAPS `CHODU.COM` TO IP `8.8.8.8`)

[2] `/ETC/RESOLV.CONF`
- SPECIFIES THE **DNS SERVERS** USED BY THE SYSTEM TO RESOLVE DOMAIN NAMES.
- YOU CAN SET MULTIPLE DNS SERVERS AND OPTIONS.
- EXAMPLE:

  NAMESERVER 8.8.8.8
  NAMESERVER 1.1.1.1

[3] `/ETC/NETWORK/INTERFACES` *(DEBIAN-BASED SYSTEMS ONLY)*
- USED TO MANUALLY CONFIGURE **IP ADDRESSES** AND NETWORK SETTINGS.
- YOU CAN DEFINE STATIC OR DYNAMIC IPS HERE.
- EXAMPLE STATIC IP CONFIG:
  ```
  AUTO ETH0
  IFACE ETH0 INET STATIC
      ADDRESS 192.168.1.10
      NETMASK 255.255.255.0
      GATEWAY 192.168.1.1

[4] `/ETC/SYSCONFIG/NETWORK-SCRIPTS/` *(REDHAT-BASED SYSTEMS ONLY)*
- CONTAINS NETWORK CONFIGURATION FILES FOR EACH NETWORK INTERFACE.
- FILE NAMES FOLLOW THIS PATTERN:

  IFCFG-<INTERFACE_NAME>

- EXAMPLE: `IFCFG-ETH0`

[5] `/ETC/NSSWITCH.CONF`
- CONTROLS **NAME RESOLUTION ORDER** FOR THE SYSTEM.
- HELPS DECIDE WHETHER TO CHECK `/ETC/HOSTS` OR `DNS` (FROM `/ETC/RESOLV.CONF`) FIRST.
- EXAMPLE:

  HOSTS: FILES DNS		# THIS MEANS: CHECK `/ETC/HOSTS` FIRST, THEN DNS.
