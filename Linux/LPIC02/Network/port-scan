# Topic: Port Scanning in Linux

## 1. What is Port Scanning?

- Port scanning is the process of **checking which ports are open** on a machine (local or remote).
- It helps you identify which services are running and which ports are accessible from the network.

## 2. Why is Port Scanning used?

* To **check if a service is running** (like SSH, HTTP)
* To **troubleshoot network/firewall issues**
* To **test network security** and find open/unsafe ports
* To **map network services** before penetration testing

## 3. Port Types

| Port Range  | Description                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| 0–1023      | Well-known ports (reserved) |
| 1024–49151  | Registered ports            |
| 49152–65535 | Dynamic/private ports       |

## 4. Common Port Scanning Tools

### 4.1 Using `nc` (netcat)
$ nc -zv <target-ip> <start-port>-<end-port>

Example:

$ nc -zv 192.168.1.10 20-80

* `-z`: Zero-I/O mode (just check if ports are open)
* `-v`: Verbose (shows which ports are open/closed)

### 4.2 Using `nmap` (most powerful tool)

Install it first:

$ sudo apt install nmap   # Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo yum install nmap   # CentOS/RHEL

#### Scan top 1000 ports (default):
$ nmap 192.168.1.10

#### Scan all 65535 ports:
$ nmap -p- 192.168.1.10


#### Scan specific ports:
$ nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10

#### Detect service and version:
$ nmap -sV 192.168.1.10

#### OS detection (if permitted by firewall):
$ nmap -O 192.168.1.10

### 4.3 Using `lsof` (for local port check)
- To see all listening ports on your own machine:
$ lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

### 4.4 Using `ss` or `netstat` (for local system)
- Show listening ports on your machine:
$ ss -tulnp

Or:

$ netstat -tulnp

## 5. Summary

* Port scanning helps you find which services are open and reachable on a machine.
* Use `nc` for quick checks.
* Use `nmap` for detailed and large-scale scans.
* Use `ss` or `lsof` for local system port checks.
