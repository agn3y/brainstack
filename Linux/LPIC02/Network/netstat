# Topic: `netstat` Command in Linux

## 1. What is `netstat`?

`netstat` stands for "network statistics".
It is a command-line tool used to monitor network connections, ports, and interface statistics.

## 2. Why is `netstat` used?

* To see all active network connections.
* To check which ports are open and listening.
* To identify which programs (by PID) are using which ports.
* To view routing tables.
* To check network interface statistics.

## 3. Basic Syntax

netstat [options]

## 4. Commonly Used Options

| Option | Meaning                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-t`   | Show TCP connections only                       |
| `-u`   | Show UDP connections only                       |
| `-l`   | Show only listening sockets                     |
| `-n`   | Show addresses and ports in numeric format      |
| `-p`   | Show PID and name of the program using the port |
| `-i`   | Show network interface statistics               |
| `-r`   | Show routing table                              |
| `-a`   | Show all connections and listening ports        |

## 5. Most Common Command

netstat -tulnp

This shows:

* All **listening** TCP/UDP ports
* In **numeric** format (no DNS lookups)
* With **PID and program name**

## 6. Output Fields (for `-tulnp`)

* **Proto**: Protocol (TCP/UDP)
* **Recv-Q / Send-Q**: Data queue sizes
* **Local Address**: IP and port on the system
* **Foreign Address**: Connected peer (if any)
* **State**: Connection state (LISTEN, ESTABLISHED, etc.)
* **PID/Program name**: Which process is using the socket

## 7. Replacement (Modern Alternative)

'netstat` is now considered outdated. Use `ss` instead:

$ ss -tulnp

Faster and more detailed.

## 8. Summary

* `netstat` helps you monitor and troubleshoot network activity.
* Most useful for checking open ports and identifying which programs are using them.
* Still useful, but replaced by `ss` in newer systems.
