Scenario 1: Samba Server in an Office (Windows + Linux Users on Same Network)

- Boss asked you to install a **Samba file server** so all employees (some on Windows, some on Linux) can share files easily over the same LAN (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

* Create a shared folder on Linux server.
* Make it accessible to **both Windows and Linux users**.
* Everyone is on the **same router**, either wired or wireless.
* Keep it **simple and open** for now (no password).

1. Install Samba on the Linux Server

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install samba samba-common samba-client -y

2. Create a Shared Folder

$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/public
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /srv/samba/public

Explanation:

* `777` → full access (read/write) for everyone
* This is for open sharing in LAN (you can make it secure later)

3. Configure Samba Share

$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

At the **bottom**, add:

[PublicShare]
   comment = Public Folder for All Employees
   path = /srv/samba/public
   guest ok = yes
   read only = no
   force user = nobody
   browsable = yes
# Save and Exit

4. Test Configuration and Restart Services

$ testparm

If no error:

$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
$ sudo systemctl restart nmbd

5. Find Server IP Address

On the Samba server, run:

$ ip a

Look for something like:

inet 192.168.1.100

This IP will be used by others to connect.

6. Access Samba Share from Client Machines

From Windows:

* Open **Run (Win + R)** → type:

  \\192.168.1.100\PublicShare

* Press Enter → folder opens → no login needed

From Linux:

* Open file manager → Go to:

  smb://192.168.1.100/PublicShare

* Or mount with command:

$ sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.100/PublicShare /mnt


*** Optional: Allow Samba Through Firewall (if enabled)

$ sudo ufw allow 'Samba'
