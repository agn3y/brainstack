SAMBA - File Sharing Over Network (Linux to Windows)

What is Samba?

* Samba allows **sharing files and printers** over a **network**.
* It enables **Linux systems to communicate with Windows systems** using the **SMB protocol**.
* It is **Linuxâ€™s version of SMB (Server Message Block)**, which is used in Windows for file and printer sharing.

Why Use Samba?

* Share **folders and printers** between **Linux and Windows**.
* Works over **TCP/IP** in a **LAN (Local Area Network)**.
* Makes **Linux behave like a Windows file server**.
* Useful in **mixed OS environments** (Linux and Windows together).

SMB in Windows

* **SMB (Server Message Block)** is the protocol used by **Windows** to share files and printers.
* It supports **file access, printer sharing**, and even **serial port sharing** over a network.

Samba in Linux

* Samba implements **SMB protocol on Linux**.
* It allows **Windows clients to access Linux files and printers**.
* It translates Linux filesystem permissions to Windows-style access.

How to Install Samba

$ sudo apt install samba samba-client samba-common -y

Samba Configuration File

Main config file:

/etc/samba/smb.conf

Samba User Security Types

[1] User Security (default)

* Each user must provide **username + password**.
* Common and secure method.
* Users are created on the system and added to Samba using:

$ sudo smbpasswd -a username

[2] Share Security

* **Only password** is required to access the shared folder.
* Username is **not checked** at connection time.
* Weak security model.
* Example problem:

* If user1 connects using the password of user3, Samba **treats them as user3**.
* Mostly used for **public or low-security folders**.
