DHCP Relay â€“ Simplified Explanation and Setup Guide

- When a client device is **not on the same network** as the DHCP server, it **cannot get an IP directly**.
- In this case, we use a **DHCP Relay Agent** â€“ a device that **forwards DHCP requests** between the client and the server, **acting as a bridge**.

Scenario:

* A **client** on one network wants an IP.
* The **DHCP server** is on a **different network**.
* A **middle device (relay agent)** helps them communicate.

Steps to Configure DHCP Relay

Step 1: Configure DHCP Server

Go to your **main DHCP server** and **add a new IP pool** for the remote network.

Edit the DHCP config file:

$ sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

Add this configuration block:


subnet 172.16.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 172.16.1.25 172.16.1.200;
    option routers 172.16.1.15;
    default-lease-time 2000;
    max-lease-time 5000;
    option domain-name "choduchaman.com";
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;
}

ðŸ”¸ `172.16.1.15` is the IP of the **relay agent** (middle device).
ðŸ”¸ Save and exit the file.

Restart the DHCP server:

$ sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server


Step 2: Configure Relay Agent (Middle Device)

1. Set the correct IP on your interface:

Remove the current IP:

$ sudo ip addr del <CURRENT_IP>/24 dev enp0s3

Add the IP from the subnet you configured:

$ sudo ip addr add 172.16.1.15/24 dev enp0s3

Replace `enp0s3` with your actual network interface name.
You can check interfaces using `ip a`.

2. Install DHCP Relay Package:

$ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-relay -y

3. Configure the DHCP Relay:

Edit the relay config file:

$ sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay

Set the following:


SERVERS="10.10.1.10"            # IP of your main DHCP server
INTERFACES="enp0s3"             # Interface connected to the client
OPTIONS=""


4. Restart the Relay Service:

$ sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-relay

Summary:

* DHCP Relay allows IP assignment **across different networks**.
* The **relay agent forwards** DHCP packets between **client** and **server**.
* You configure the **DHCP server with the correct subnet**, and the **relay with correct routes and interfaces
