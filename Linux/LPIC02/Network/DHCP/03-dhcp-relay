WHEN A CLIENT WHICH IS NOT WITHIN SAME NETWORK WANTS AN IP TO BECOME PART OF THIS NETWORK WE USE THIS CASE OF DHCP RELAY.
SUPPOSE THER IS A DEVICE WHICH WANT TO CONNECT TO SOME SERVER BUT BEACUSE THEY ARE NOT ON SAME NETWORK WE NEED SOME DEVICE WHICH WILL ACTS AS A BRIDGE FOR THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH EEACHOTHER THAT DEVICE IS CALLED A RELAY DEVICE.
SO ON THE MEDIATERY DEVICE WE WILL HAVE TO INSTALL THIS PACKAGE AND DO SOME CONFIGURATION

FIRST CONFIGURE ANOTHER POOL OF IPS
GO BACK TO THE DHCP CONFIGURATON SERVER
THE $ sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf AND THEN ADD THIS CONTENT

subnet 172.16.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	range 172.16.1.25 172.16.1.200;
	option routers 172.16.1.15;
	default-lease-time 2000;
	max-release 5000;
	option domain-name "choduchaman.com";
	option domain-name-server 8.8.8.8;
}

NOW SAVE AND EXIT

THEN INSTALL PACKAGE ON MEDIATORY DEVICE
GO TO YOUR RELAY AGENT
$ sudo ip add dd 10.10.1.21/24 dev enp0s3	# UPDATE IT WITH YOUR INTERFACE

AND REMOVE CURRENT IP USING
$ sudo ip add del CURRENT_IP dev enp0s3	# CHANGE IT WITH YOUR INTERFACE

ADD INTERFACE
$ sudo ip add add 172.16.1.15/24  dev enp0s3

AND THEN INSTALL THIS PACKAGE
$ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-relay -y

AND THEN ENTER IP OF THE MAIN DHCP SERVERS IP THAT YOU WANT TO GET YOUR IP FROM

AND THEN ADD INTERFACE WHICH WILL LISTEN TO THE BRODCAST

THE MAIN FILE OF THIS PACKAGE IS LOCATED AT /etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay
