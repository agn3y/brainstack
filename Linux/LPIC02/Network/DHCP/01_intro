DHCP - DYNAMIC HOST CONFIGURATION PROTOCOL
- DHCP is a system that gives IP addresses automatically to devices (like your phone or computer) so they can connect to the network without you setting IP manually.

* DHCP POOL
- A DHCP Pool is a group or range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can give out to devices.
- Example: IPs from 192.168.1.100 to 192.168.1.200 are in the pool. When a device connects, it gets one IP from this pool.

* How DHCP Works — Remember with DORA:

* D = DISCOVER:** Your device asks “Who is there? I need an IP.”
* O = OFFER:** DHCP server says “I have this IP for you.”
* R = REQUEST:** Your device says “I want that IP.”
* A = ACKNOWLEDGE:** DHCP server says “OK, this IP is yours now.”

* Lease Time
- When DHCP gives an IP, it’s only for some time. This is called the **lease time**. After lease time ends, the device must ask again for an IP (or renew the same one). This helps manage IPs efficiently.

* Types of IP Addresses DHCP Can Assign:

* Dynamic IP:** Random IP from the DHCP pool given for lease time.
* Static IP (Reserved IP):** You can tell DHCP to always give the same IP to a device based on its MAC address (like a fixed home address).

* Extra simple example:

- Think of DHCP like a hotel receptionist giving room keys:

* You arrive (DISCOVER) → receptionist offers a room (OFFER) → you say “I’ll take this one” (REQUEST) → receptionist gives you the key (ACKNOWLEDGE) with a checkout time (lease time).
