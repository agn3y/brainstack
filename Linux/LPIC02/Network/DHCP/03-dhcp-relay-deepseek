# **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - Complete Guide**  

1. What is DHCP?  
- DHCP (**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**) is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters (like subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers) to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration.  

Key Benefits of DHCP:  
- Automation: No manual IP assignment required.  
- Centralized Management: IP settings are managed from a DHCP server.  
- Reduced Errors: Minimizes IP conflicts.  
- Efficient IP Usage: IPs are leased temporarily and reused when not needed.  

2. DHCP Configuration  

Basic DHCP Server Configuration (Example: Cisco Router)  
To configure a Cisco router as a DHCP server:  

Router(config)# ip dhcp pool LAN_POOL  
Router(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0  
Router(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.1.1  
Router(dhcp-config)# dns-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4  
Router(dhcp-config)# lease 7  # Lease time in days  
Router(dhcp-config)# exit  

# Exclude reserved IPs (e.g., for servers)  
Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10   

Key DHCP Parameters:  
- Network: The subnet to assign IPs from (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).  
- Default Gateway: The router’s IP (`192.168.1.1`).  
- DNS Server: Provides domain name resolution.  
- Lease Time: How long a device keeps the IP before renewal.  

3. DHCP Relay (DHCP Helper)  

# What is DHCP Relay?  
- In large networks, DHCP servers may not be on the same subnet as clients. A **DHCP Relay Agent** forwards DHCP requests from clients to a DHCP server in another subnet.  

# Why Use DHCP Relay?  
- Allows a single DHCP server to manage multiple subnets.  
- Eliminates the need for a DHCP server on every subnet.  

# DHCP Relay Configuration (Cisco Router/Switch)
Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0  
Router(config-if)# ip helper-address 10.0.0.2  # IP of DHCP server  `  

# How DHCP Relay Works: 
1. A client broadcasts a **DHCP Discover** message.  
2. The relay agent (router) receives it and forwards it as a **unicast** to the DHCP server.  
3. The DHCP server responds with an offer, sent back via the relay agent.  


# 4. Important DHCP Messages**  
- **DHCP Discover** – Client broadcasts to find a DHCP server.  
- **DHCP Offer** – Server responds with an available IP.  
- **DHCP Request** – Client requests the offered IP.  
- **DHCP Ack** – Server confirms the lease.  
- **DHCP Release** – Client voluntarily releases the IP.  
- **DHCP NAK** – Server denies a request (e.g., if lease expired).

## **5. Troubleshooting DHCP**  
- **Check Lease Assignments:**  
  ```bash
  show ip dhcp binding  # (Cisco)  
  ```  
- **Verify DHCP Pool:**  
  ```bash
  show ip dhcp pool  
  ```  
- **Test Client Connectivity:**  
  - Use `ipconfig /release` & `ipconfig /renew` (Windows).  
  - Use `dhclient -r` & `dhclient` (Linux).  


## **6. Security Considerations**  
- **DHCP Snooping (Switch Security Feature):** Prevents rogue DHCP servers.  
- **IP Reservations:** Assign fixed IPs to critical devices (like servers).
