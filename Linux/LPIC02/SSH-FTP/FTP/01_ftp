FTP - FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL
PORT - 20, 21
PORT 20 ACTUALLY TRANSFER DATA
PORT 21 USUALLY HANDLES CONNECTION

THIS IS KNOWN AS ACTIVE FTP

WHEN CLIENT GENERATE A FTP REQUEST USING PORT 9898 THE SERVER ACCEPT THAT ON PORT 20 AMD CREATE ITS OWN REQUEST ON 21 AND SERVER INITIATES NEW FTP CONNECTION USING 21 AND FOR CLIENT SIDE IT IS 9899 NOW A FIRE WALL WOUDNT ALLOW THAT SO FOR THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED PASSIVE 

HOW WILL THAT WORK LETS SEE 
AGAIN CLIENT OPEN FTP REQUEST USING 9898 AND SERVER RECOGNIZE THAT ON PORT 21 NOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN FTP SERVER CREATE A PROCESS AND THEN TELL THE CLIENT USING PORT 9898 TO HEY I HAVE OPEN A SERVICE FOR YOU ON 7777 PORT AND YOU SHOULD USE THAT FOR FTP SO CLIENT AGAIN CREATE REQUEST USING 9898 BUT TO 7777 AND THATS HOW WE MANAGE TO USE FTP WHILE THE FIREWALL STAYS ON
