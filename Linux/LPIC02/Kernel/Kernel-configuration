/proc/sys/kernel this location has live setting stored.

/etc/sysctl.conf - how the Linux kernel behaves, such as how it manages memory, networking, or security.

between sysctl.conf and sysctl.d the conf file has precedence.

THERE IS COMMAND WHICH IS ALSO VERY USEFULL AND ONLY BE USED AS ROOT.
Use $ man sysctl to get more information

IN MODERN LINUX SYSTEM COMMAND WE WILL HAVE TO [ udevd DAEMON ] command.
udev handles of loading and unloading module.

we can use [ lsusb ] and [ lspci ] also [ lsdev ]
lsdev - display information about installed hardware

To administer we have two commands
[1] udevmonitor - old depricated command
[2] udevadm monitor - yes the way it is written is the correct way.
