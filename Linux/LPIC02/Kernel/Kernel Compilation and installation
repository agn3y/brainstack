To compile kernel we will first need source code of kernel.

Which we can download from kernel.org

- Download kernel file and extract at /usr/src/
- Create a symlink to extract folder
- go to symlink then Documentation 
- then run $ apt install make gcc libncurses-dev 
- $ man make
- now go to /usr/src/symlink and then $ make clean
- then install fkex and bison using apt
- and then make menuconfig
- and save and we will get a .config file
- then do $ make bzimage 
- then $ make modules
- now to install modules using $ make modules_install
- copy the bzimage to /boot and create { initramfs } file to do this we have command name [ $ mkinitramfs ] for ubuntu And for red hat based systems we can use [ $ mkinitrd ] which calls dracut which creates initial image used by kernel for preloading block devices.
- to run this compiled kernel we have to modify grub configuration

SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT KERNEL THAT IT COMES IN 2 TYPES:
[1] zimage - older systems, size upto only 512kb
[2] bzimage - bigzimage - handles kernel which are bigger than 512kb
