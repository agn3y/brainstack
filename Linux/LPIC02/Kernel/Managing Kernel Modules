Use [ $ depmod ] command to find information about current kernel
We can also use [ $ uname -r ]
We can also see loaded modules using [ $ lsmod ]
We can target module to remove [ $ rmmod ]
We can use command to insert modules using [ $ insmod ]. To use this command we have to locate kernerl module and then we can use it correctly.
$ insmod /lib/modules/kerner-version-file/kernel-file.ko # file with ko extension

Now there is a modern approach to do this operation
which is [ $ modprobe ]

to remove module we can use
$ modprobe-r data_acpi

to install it again
$ modprobe data_acpi
# Advantage that we dont have to specify absolute path of kernel module itself
# How it works, when we use depmod command it creates a depmod.deb. which will be used by modprobe then.
