Packaging Basics – Software Installation and File Locations

This note explains how we can install software and where we should place source code and applications in a Linux system. It also covers basic decompression tools.

1. Software and Source Code Locations
/usr/src
→ Used to store system-wide source code (like Linux kernel source).

/usr/local
→ Used to install programs manually (locally).
→ Commonly used by system administrators for custom software not managed by the package manager.

/usr/local/src
→ Another place to store local source code (especially when compiling software manually).

/opt
→ Used for third-party or add-on software (like Chrome, Skype, or other external apps).
→ Good location for self-contained applications.

2. Decompression Commands
To decompress .gz files:
→ Use gunzip filename.gz

To decompress .bz2 or .bz files:
→ Use bunzip2 filename.bz2

To decompress .xz files:
→ Use unxz filename.xz
→ Or use xz -d filename.xz

3. Summary
Use specific directories like /usr/local and /opt for installing and managing software manually.
Source code is usually stored in /usr/src or /usr/local/src.
Always match the decompression tool with the file extension (.gz, .bz2, .xz).
