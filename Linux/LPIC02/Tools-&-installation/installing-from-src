# **Installing Programs from Source (Packaging Basics Continued)**

## **1. Steps to Install Software from Source**

* **Step 1: Download the source code**
→ Usually comes as a `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2`, or `.tar.xz` file.

* **Step 2: Extract the archive**
→ For `.tar.gz`: `tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz`
→ For `.tar.bz2`: `tar -xvjf filename.tar.bz2`
→ For `.tar.xz`: `tar -xvJf filename.tar.xz`

* **Step 3: Enter the extracted folder**
→ Use `cd foldername`

* **Step 4: Run the configuration script**
→ `./configure`
→ This checks your system and prepares the build files.
→ You can add options like:
`./configure --prefix=/usr/local` (sets install location)

* **Step 5: Compile the source code**
→ `make`
→ This compiles the source into binary (executable) files.

* **Step 6: Install the program**
→ `sudo make install`
→ This copies files to appropriate system directories.

## **2. Optional Commands**

* **Clean up build files after install:**
→ `make clean`
→ Deletes temporary files created during compilation.

* **Uninstall (if supported):**
→ `sudo make uninstall`
→ Only works if the Makefile has uninstall instructions.
  
## **3. Summary**

* Installing from source gives you full control, but you must compile it manually.
* You must have tools like `gcc`, `make`, and `build-essential` installed.
* Common install path: `/usr/local`
* Use `./configure`, `make`, and `make install` in order.


## **What happens when you run `sudo make uninstall`?**

* `make uninstall` only removes the **installed files** (binaries, config files, etc.) that were copied to your system during `make install`.
* It **does NOT delete**:
* The **source code**
* The **compiled files** (like `.o` object files or compiled binaries) inside the source folder
* The **build directory** or any **temporary files**

## **So to clean up everything you built:**

After running `sudo make uninstall`, you should also run:

* `make clean`
→ This removes all compiled object files and binaries from the source folder.

* `make distclean` *(if available)*
→ This removes everything `make clean` does plus the `Makefile` and configuration files created by `./configure`.

## **If you want to remove everything including the source:**

* After running:

1. `sudo make uninstall`
2. `make clean` or `make distclean`

* Then delete the source directory manually:

$ cd ..
$ rm -rf angband-source-folder

*(Replace `angband-source-folder` with the actual folder name you extracted.)*
