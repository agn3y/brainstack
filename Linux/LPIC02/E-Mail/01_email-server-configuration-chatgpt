Email Server Configuration (Postfix, SMTP, POP3, IMAP)

## Basic Terms (Must Know)

### SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

* Used to send email
* Runs on Port 25
* Responsible for transferring email between servers.

### POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3)

* Downloads emails from the server to your machine.
* After downloading, the mail is deleted from the server
* Best for single-device access

### IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)

* Reads emails directly from the server
* Mails stay on the server
* Best for multi-device access (e.g., mobile + desktop).

## Email Workflow Components

| Component                     | Role                                  | Example              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **MUA** (Mail User Agent)     | Email client used by the user         | Thunderbird, Outlook |
| **MTA** (Mail Transfer Agent) | Transfers email from sender to server | Postfix, Sendmail    |
| **MDA** (Mail Delivery Agent) | Delivers mail to user’s mailbox       | Procmail, Dovecot    |

## Install and Configure Postfix (Mail Server)

Step 1: Install required packages

$ sudo apt install postfix mailutils -y

* During setup:

  * Select: **Internet Site**
  * Enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`)

Step 2: Configuration File Location

$ sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

**Do not touch `relayhost`** unless you know what you're doing — it can break delivery.

Step 3: Test Sending Mail

$ mail -s "Subject goes here" yourmail@domain.com

* `cc:` → leave empty
* Type your message
* End it by pressing `Ctrl + D`

Step 4: Check Mail Locally

$ mail

Step 5: Send Mail to Local User

$ sudo mail -s "Testing Local Mail" root@localhost

* Leave `cc:` empty
* Type message
* Press `Ctrl + D`

To read it:

$ sudo su   # become root
$ mail

## Email Aliases (Forwarding Mails)

### Step 1: Edit alias file

$ sudo nano /etc/aliases

Add an alias like:

admin: root
shun: agn3y

Step 2: Update aliases

$ sudo newaliases

## Scenario:

You are managing a server where **system logs and alerts** are sent to your email. Instead of checking logs manually, you want critical services (like cron or fail2ban to notify you via email.

Solution:

* Install **Postfix** as a local mail server.
* Set up email alias so that `root` emails are forwarded to your email.
* Now, whenever something important happens (e.g., cron job fails), you'll **automatically get an email**.

Example:

$ echo "Disk usage critical" | mail -s "Disk Alert" root@localhost

This is used in **DevOps monitoring setups**, alert systems, or service notifications.

| Topic          | Purpose                                             |

| IMAP           | Read mail from server, keeps sync                   |
| Postfix        | Mail server software (MTA)                          |
| mailutils      | CLI email client to send/receive/test               |
| aliases        | Forward emails to other users                       |
| `mail` command | Check emails from terminal                          |
