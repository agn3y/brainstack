Local Email Management using Postfix and Procmail

### Where is Mail Stored by Default?

* By default, all user emails are stored in:

  * `/var/spool/mail/username`  **OR**
  * `/var/mail/username`

* All new mails are appended** to the same file (`username` file), which can make it large and hard to manage.

Solution: Procmail

Procmail is a **mail processing utility**. It can filter, sort, and store emails better than the default method.

Procmail Operating Modes

1. mbox Format (Not preferred)

* Same idea as the default `/var/mail/username`
* But moves email file to user's home:

  * Example: `/home/agn3y/mail/inbox`
* Still stores all emails in one file — not efficient

2. Maildir Format (Preferred)

* Stores each email as a separate file
* Structure: `/home/username/Maildir/new/`
* Helps manage mail efficiently
* Many modern tools prefer this format

### Installing Procmail

$ sudo apt install procmail

### Setting Up Postfix to Use Procmail

#### Edit Postfix config:

$ sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

Go to the **end of file (EOF)** and add:

mailbox_command = procmail

Then restart/reload Postfix:

$ sudo systemctl reload postfix

#### Alternate method without editing manually:

$ sudo postconf -e "mailbox_command=procmail"

### Global vs Per-User Configuration

#### Global Settings (`/etc/procmailrc`)

Create the file (if it doesn’t exist):

$ sudo nano /etc/procmailrc

Add this:

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/inbox        # mbox style
# DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/inbox/new  # if using Maildir-style

#### User-Specific Settings (`~/.procmailrc`)

Create in user’s home directory:

$ touch ~/.procmailrc
$ nano ~/.procmailrc

Example to filter mail with recipient `root`:

:0:
* ^TOroot
rootfile

Another example to filter by subject line:

:0:
* ^Subject:.*priority
priorityfile

These rules work like filters. If mail matches, it's saved in that file instead of inbox.

### Accessing the Mailbox

To read mails using the `mail` command and custom inbox:

$ mail -f /home/agn3y/mail/inbox

### Real-Life Example 1 — Filter Root Mails

You are getting system emails from `root`, but you want them in a separate file:

:0:
* ^TOroot
/home/agn3y/mail/root-mails

Real-Life Example 2 — Filter Priority Alerts

Suppose your app sends email with subject "priority alert". You want those in a different folder:

:0:
* ^Subject:.*priority alert
/home/agn3y/mail/alerts

* Regex is important to match email subjects, headers, and senders:

  * `^TO` — Matches recipients
  * `^Subject:` — Matches subject lines
