MAIL STORED IN /var/spool/mail/username OR SOMETIME JUST /var/mail/username

NEW FILE WILL BE APPENDED TO SAME FILE username IN OUR CASE

solution to this is procmail which put mails 

two way procmail can operate

[1] mbox
- well it kind work same as above mentioned thats why it not preferwd method.
- only differnce that it changes the location of the file and this will be user specific so it will be in every users home directory

[2]MAILDIR
-THIS WILL STORE EMAIL INDIVIDUALLY /etc/user/inbox

NOW TO INSTALL PROCMAIL
$ sudo apt install procmail

NOW WE ARE GONNA ACTUALLY USE POSTFIX FOR THIS SO NAVIGATE TO
$ sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

GO TO EOF AND ADD THIS CONTENT

mailbox_command=procmail	# done and save and reload service 

WE CAN ALSO DO IT OTHER WAY USING THIS COMMAND
$ postconf	# works without reloading server 

ACTUAL COMMAND FOR CONFIGUARTION WOULD BE  
$ sudo postconf -e  "mailbox_command=procmail"

IT CAN BE CONFIGURED GLOBALLY TO WORK WILL EVERY USER ON SYSTEM
PARTICULAR USERS WITH PARTICULAR SETTINGS
weARE CREATING A FILE ACTUALLLY IN /etc/procmailrc

AND ADD THIS CONTENT IN FILE

MAILDIR=$HOME/mail
DEFAULT=$HOME/mail/inbox				# MBOX FIRST METHOD
DEFAULT=$HOME/mail/inbox/msg-stored-here		# MBOX SECOND METHOD

to make mail command work with first method we will have to specify wherebouts of inbox file we can done it using

$ mail -f /home/agn3y/mail/inbox	# now mail command have the access to the messages

SECOND METHOD

create file in users home directory

$ touch .procmailrc 

ADD THIS CONTENT IN FILE

:0:
* ^TOroot
rootfile

OR WE CAN ADD SOMETHING LIKE

:0:
* ^Subject: priority
priorityfile

## THIS ABOVE GIVEN FILE KINDA WORK AS FILTER SO EVERYTIME WE HAVE priority IT WILL CREATE A SEPRATE PRIORITY FILE NOT TO SIMPLE MAIL FILE
