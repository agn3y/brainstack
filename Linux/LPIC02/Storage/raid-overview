# RAID – What is it?
- Imagine you have many boxes (disks) to store your stuff (data).
- RAID mixes these boxes to keep your stuff safe and/or faster to use.

RAID Levels (Like real life examples)

RAID 0 – Striping (Speed but no backup)
- Like cutting your file into pieces and putting each piece in a different box.
- You find parts faster, but if one box is lost, whole file is lost.
- Good if you want speed only.

RAID 1 – Mirroring (Exact copy)
- Like having two identical boxes with the same stuff inside.
- If one box is lost, the other still has everything.
- Very safe but needs double space.

RAID 5 – Striping + Parity (Backup with speed)
- Imagine you cut file into parts and also write a special note (parity) to help rebuild if one box is lost.
- Can lose 1 box without losing data.
- Good balance of safety and speed.

RAID 6 – Like RAID 5 but safer
- Same as RAID 5, but can lose 2 boxes at the same time without losing data.

RAID 10 – Mirroring + Striping (Best of both)
-Combine two RAID 1 boxes (mirrors), then split data between these pairs.

Fast and safe but needs many boxes.

[*] How to create RAID on computer (software RAID)
- Use tool called mdadm to manage RAID on Linux.

Example: Make two boxes mirror (RAID 1)
$ sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc

Remember:

- RAID protects from broken boxes (disks), not from losing stuff by mistake or theft. Always keep backups somewhere else!
- RAID 0 = speed, no safety
- RAID 1 = safety, no speed
- RAID 5 & 6 = mix of both
- RAID 10 = fast + safe but needs many disks
