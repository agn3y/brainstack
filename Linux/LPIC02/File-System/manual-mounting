* The file named install-fs was about creating paertition and installing file system on it, And this file is how we can mount/unmount those partition in system.

* Two main commands
[1] mount
[2] umount

* we can use lsblk to find list of block devices

- lsblk -f

* mount

- $ mount | grep sda
- Its pulling all the information about mounted devices from /etc/mtab 
- And we can also pull this information from /proc/mounts
- We can use -n flag which will mount device without updating this file
- mount using $ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /media/agn3y/
- above gicen step [ use lsblk and find out fs installed on it and mount it using as above command to desired location ]

*umount

- $ umount /dev/sdb1 (describe the path where device is mounted)
-  or we can also use the uuid to unmount 
- $ umount -u "uuid"
- we can also specify the path where partition is mounted but lets stick to above given methods


Note :

- this changes are not permanent if we reboot the machine all changes we made will be lost
