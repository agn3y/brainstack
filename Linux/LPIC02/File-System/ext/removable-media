* ISO9660 and Removable Media
- When we talk about removable media (like CD/DVD), we usually refer to the ISO9660 file system.
- Originally, it was known as High Sierra Format (HSF) → later standardized as ISO9660.
- ISO9660 is read-only and used for writing data to optical discs like CD-ROMs.

* ISO9660 Extensions (to improve flexibility)
1. Joliet – adds support for Unicode and longer file names (used by Windows)
2. Rock Ridge – adds UNIX file permissions, symbolic links, and long file names
3. El Torito – allows the CD to be used as a bootable device
