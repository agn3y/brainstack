[*] SMART – Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology
- Used to monitor disk health (especially HDDs and SSDs)
- $ sudo apt install smartmontools -y
- Enable and use smartctl with the smartd daemon

To check health status of a drive:
$ sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda

Note: 
- SMART works on the whole disk, not partition.

[*] autofs

- When a system boots, some partitions are auto-mounted — these are defined in /etc/fstab
- But autofs is a different system used to automount on-demand
- Unlike fstab (which mounts at boot), autofs mounts when a directory is accessed and unmounts it after inactivity
- its like mounted when needed and then unmounted when not
- installing use
- sudo apt install autofs which creates files which are
- autofs.conf, auto.master, auto.misc, auto.net, auto.smb
- auto.master is the first file we should take a look at
- edit masterf file like [ nfs  /home/user/nfs ]
- and then in etc create auto.nfs edit it and write
- videos 192.168.23.12:/monekyoussy/videos
- now whenever we open videos this all data from server will be loaded over a network
- inshort edit master file and write something like [ /nameoffolder /path/auto.nameoffolder ] then go back in etc then touch and create auto.nameoffolder and then in created file do something like[ foldername 192.168.2.33:/foldername/video ] 

Used for things like:

- On-demand USB or NFS mounts
- Reducing boot time
